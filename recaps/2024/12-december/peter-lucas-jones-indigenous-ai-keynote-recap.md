# Indigenous AI & Data Sovereignty - Peter Lucas Jones Keynote Recap
**Vancouver AI Community | December 2024**
**Speaker:** Peter Lucas Jones (Time's 100 Most Influential in AI 2024)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Peter Lucas Jones from Te Aupouri, New Zealand, presented a groundbreaking model for indigenous-led AI development that prioritizes data sovereignty, cultural preservation, and economic self-determination. His organization developed the world's first indigenous language automatic speech recognition system while establishing revolutionary data licensing frameworks that protect indigenous knowledge from exploitation.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### 1. Data Sovereignty is Innovation
The most innovative achievement wasn't the technology itself but the **data license** that ensures AI tools cannot be used for surveillance, discrimination, or mining of Māori data. This legal framework preserves economic opportunities for indigenous communities.

### 2. Community Engagement Drives Success
In just **10 days**, they gathered **316,000 tagged utterances** through a reading competition that engaged their entire community - from 90-year-olds to beginning readers. This intergenerational approach proved more effective than corporate partnerships.

### 3. Infrastructure on Indigenous Land
With NVIDIA support, they built a **GPU cluster in Kaitaia** - creating language tools in their own community, on their own land. This represents true technological self-determination.

### 4. Language is Culture's Container
"Everything about our culture is contained within our language" - including philosophical worldview, ontology, and traditional knowledge about medicine, land, and natural resources.

### 5. Trauma-Informed Design
Their pronunciation app **Rongo** never tells users what they got wrong - only celebrates what they got right, recognizing the trauma associated with reconnecting to forcibly removed language and culture.

## 💡 Revolutionary Approaches

### The Reading Competition Model
- **Problem:** 30 years of archives needing transcription
- **Solution:** Gamified community engagement
- **Result:** 316,000 utterances in 10 days
- **Impact:** Created corpus for speech recognition while strengthening cultural connection

### Data License Innovation
**Protected Against:**
- Surveillance of indigenous people
- Data tracking and mining
- Discrimination and persecution
- Unauthorized corpus building
- Commercial exploitation

**Preserved For:**
- High-value job creation in communities
- Economic base for health and wellbeing
- Indigenous-led development
- Cultural preservation

### Pronunciation Without Characters
- No written text shown (prevents English sound association)
- Audio mimicry only
- Celebrates success rather than highlighting errors
- Restores "native sound to the mouths of our people"
