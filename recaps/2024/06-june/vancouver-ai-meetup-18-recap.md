# Vancouver AI Community Meetup #18 - Recap
**Date:** June 2024  
**Location:** MacMillan Space Centre, Vancouver  
**Attendees:** ~225 people  
**Milestone:** 18th consecutive monthly meetup  

---

## Executive Summary

The 18th Vancouver AI Community Meetup marked a significant milestone in community maturation, featuring the first meetup where Kris Krüg cooked BBQ for all attendees, a deeply technical keynote on Model Context Protocol security concerns, and the announcement of multiple new BC + AI Industry Association board members. The event demonstrated the community's evolution from experimental gatherings to a sophisticated ecosystem balancing technical innovation with ethical consciousness and indigenous wisdom.

---

## Key Highlights

### 🔥 First Community BBQ
- Kris Krüg personally cooked for all 225 attendees on newly purchased BBQ equipment
- Community-building through literal nourishment and shared meals  
- BBQ equipment to be amortized over next three meetups, creating ongoing tradition

### 🚨 Major Security Warning
Morten Rand-Hendriksen delivered a comprehensive technical keynote on Model Context Protocol (MCP), describing it as "very exciting and very terrifying" - essentially warning that the AI industry has created a massively insecure way for AI agents to control any system with an API, with minimal oversight or security controls.

### 🏛️ Governance Maturation  
BC + AI Industry Association gaining formal structure with new board members including Carol Ann Hilton (Indigenomics Institute) and Lorraine Lowe (Space Center Executive Director).

## Technical Deep Dive: Model Context Protocol

### What is MCP?
Morton explained MCP as a universal protocol allowing any AI model to interact with any tool or service through standardized connections. Instead of custom-building each AI-to-service integration, MCP creates a common language.

### The Security Crisis
- **Open by design:** Protocol intentionally built without security features initially
- **Massive scope:** Can connect AI to literally anything with an API (files, email, banking, home devices)
- **No visibility:** Users cannot see what AI agents are doing through MCP connections
- **Speed of adoption:** Major companies adopting within weeks, not the usual 10-year protocol development cycle

### Real Horror Stories
Morton shared personal experiments:
- **Email flood:** AI sent 8,000 emails autonomously
- **File corruption:** AI invented creative but destructive file copying method, corrupting entire folder

### Industry Response
Major tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) scrambling to add security layers after realizing developers were building MCP servers "written by insane people who don't understand secure connections."

## Community Development

### Subgroup Ecosystem Thriving
- **Surrey AI:** Successfully running parallel events with "circle talk" format allowing everyone to participate
- **Mind AI & Consciousness:** Rigorous academic group requiring reading assignments and full participation
- **AI Film Club:** Kevin launching creative community focused on filmmaking applications
- **Creative Mornings Integration:** 14-year partnership bringing creative community connections

### Intergenerational Participation
**Liam Edmonds (age 12):** Presented his project of blogging dreams and turning them into games using AI for coding assistance. Represents the community's appeal across age groups and genuine technical participation by youth.

### Corporate Change Management
**Noah Brunn (Arturs):** Leading enterprise AI adoption with focus on responsible implementation, addressing both enthusiasm and fear in professional environments.

## Hackathon Winners: "What Does It Mean to Be Canadian?"

### Winner: Matt Sinclair - Canadian Identity Simulator
Interactive 3D environment where users can walk around and have conversations with AI personas generated from survey data of 1,000 Canadians. Each character represents authentic Canadian perspectives on identity, allowing users to explore difficult political and identity conversations in a safe AI-mediated space.

**Innovation:** Probabilistic character generation system mathematically derived from survey responses. Built in Unity using "vibe coding" by someone with film background and no coding experience.

### Runner-up: Team Wisdom Lantern (Sev + April)
Created AI-generated video with indigenous voice perspective summarizing Canadian identity survey findings. Identified "great Canadian paradox" - 81% feel deeply Canadian while 62% fear political polarization.

### Honorable Mention: Swathi Rayco  
Built ComfyUI interface that converts any dataset into infinite graphic novel stories, continuing her previous "hotdog sandwich" courtroom debate project.

## Indigenous Leadership & Cultural Integration

### Gabriel George's Ongoing Presence
Rather than one-off token acknowledgments, Gabriel has become integral community member sharing different songs and stories each month. His eagle song and teachings about interconnectedness provide spiritual grounding for technical discussions.

### Board Integration
Carol Ann Hilton's joining the BC + AI board contingent on continuing ceremonial openings demonstrates authentic integration rather than performative inclusion.

### Cultural Philosophy
Gabriel's teachings about vast networks of connection and ceremony directly parallel technical discussions about AI networks and protocols, creating meaningful bridge between indigenous wisdom and modern technology.

---

## Venue Partnership Evolution

### Space Center Relationship
Nine-month partnership has evolved from restrictive rules (no food/drink) to full trust and collaboration. Lorraine Lowe, Executive Director, now wants AI workshops for staff and policy development.

**Upcoming:** Space center seeking AI integration for science education and operations.

### Physical Space
Meetup in round room designed after Coast Salish hat provides optimal acoustics for Gabriel's unmic'd singing and creates circular community atmosphere.

---

## Sponsor Ecosystem

### Financial Sustainability
- **Segev Law Firm:** $1,000/month primary sponsor
- **Schwartzman Family:** Ongoing support during difficult family period
- **Sons of Vancouver Distillery:** Ongoing beverage sponsorship plus philosophical leadership

### Community Investment
James Lester's presentation on persistence and new project evaluation provided philosophical framework for community's approach to innovation and failure tolerance.

---

## Future Trajectory Indicators

### Technical Sophistication
Discussion quality has reached professional conference levels with deep technical details and security implications analysis.

### Governance Structure
Formal nonprofit development with board appointments and community survey data (55 responses averaging 36 minutes each) showing serious community investment.

### Geographic Expansion
Surrey AI success creating template for regional expansion while maintaining community values and format innovations.

### Professional Integration
Corporate change management initiatives and responsible AI policy development showing community influence in professional contexts.

---

## Warnings & Concerns Raised

### MCP Security Crisis
Morton's keynote served as community-wide warning about AI security risks that most users don't understand. Key message: current AI-to-system integration methods are fundamentally insecure and could enable widespread chaos.

### Technology Release Pattern
Identified pattern of releasing AI technology "five years too early" before safety considerations are addressed, with MCP accelerating this problem.

### Trust and Agency Issues
Deep philosophical questions about what happens when AI systems are given human-level agency without human-level responsibility or oversight.

---

## Community Values Demonstrated

### Intellectual Honesty
Community comfortable with technical speakers warning about serious risks rather than only celebrating capabilities.

### Inclusive Participation  
12-year-old presenting alongside PhD-level researchers; Surrey community adapting format for different needs; corporate and creative participants mixing freely.

### Indigenous Integration
Ongoing commitment to ceremonial opening and indigenous perspectives rather than tokenism.

### Technical Excellence
High-level technical discussions coupled with practical applications and creative projects.

### Community Care
Physical cooking, venue care, geographic accessibility, financial accessibility all prioritized.

## Quotes That Capture the Spirit

**Gabriel George:** "We need to be connected to one another and the importance of that and not to be siloed... using these tools, these new tools, these modern tools, and using this beautiful community."

**Morten Rand-Hendriksen:** "Don't trust the user, don't trust the AI. Trust your humanity instead... Build the future. That is literally the job right now."

**James Lester:** "The commonality of success is just people who don't give up... even if it is a bad idea, there still might be something great in there, a seed of something."

**Matt Sinclair:** "Those conversations that are about identity and about politics are very difficult to have in real life. And so there's this opportunity maybe through AI to expose difficult ideas and sensitive thoughts to AI in a way that I couldn't to other people."
