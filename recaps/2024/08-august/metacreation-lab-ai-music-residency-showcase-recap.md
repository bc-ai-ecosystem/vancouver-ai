# METACREATION Lab AI Music Residency Showcase - Recap
**Vancouver AI + BC + AI Ecosystem + SFU SIAT Special Event**
**August 2024 | SFU Surrey**

---

## 🎵 Event Overview

A groundbreaking showcase demonstrating the future of AI-assisted music creation through the METACREATION Lab's artistic residency program. Three presentations revealed different approaches to AI music generation - from academic research to experimental performance to practical production tools.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### 1. Own Your Creative AI
The most revolutionary concept: Artists can train AI models exclusively on their own work, maintaining complete ownership and copyright. As Kris Krüg emphasized: "Artists like me who have made 200,000 portraits over 20 years can train an AI model on just that... I own that AI, I own that data, I own the things that come out of it."

### 2. AI Requires MORE Work, Not Less
Contrary to popular belief, AI music creation is labor-intensive. Philippe Hong spent 2-3 hours just crafting lyrics prompts, and artists are constantly breaking down, remixing, and rebuilding AI outputs to achieve their vision.

### 3. Movement Data as Musical Input
Quentin Nolo demonstrated converting non-musical data (dancer movements via Wii Nunchuck sensors) into music using Calliope AI, showing how AI can bridge completely different creative domains.

### 4. The Future is Personalized Models
[[Philippe Pasquier]] predicted a shift from generic AI tools to personalized systems: "Right now you use generic AI tools that are supposed to be one size fits all, but the future is going to be personalized... If you're a poet, gather your poetry to yourself."

### 5. Community-Engaged Design is Critical
The residency model engages artists directly in AI tool development, ensuring tools serve real creative needs rather than theoretical capabilities.

## 💡 Technologies Showcased

### Calliope - Music GPT
- **What it does:** Generates musical scores (MIDI) trained on vast database of all music styles
- **Key feature:** Prompt with your own music to generate complementary tracks
- **Use case:** Game composers needing thousands of variations, musicians seeking inspiration

### Autolume - Neural Visual Synthesizer
- **What it does:** Allows artists to train models on their own visual work
- **Key feature:** Real-time control via physical controllers, no coding required
- **Use case:** Visual artists creating personalized AI models for their unique style

### MML Plugin for Cubase/Ableton
- **What it does:** Integrates AI generation directly into production software
- **Key feature:** Style transfer, variation generation, arrangement assistance
- **Use case:** Producers needing quick variations or breaking creative blocks

- Demonstrated Kraftwerk remix through multiple genre transformations
- Used combination of MML, Suno, ChatGPT for complete productions

---

## 🚀 Practical Applications

### For Game Development
- Generate thousands of hours of variations from single composed theme
- Create contextual music (battle, peaceful, victory) automatically
- Reduce composer workload while maintaining artistic vision

### For Individual Artists
- Train models on personal portfolio for copyright-free generation
- Overcome creative blocks with AI suggestions
- Accelerate production without losing personal style
- Learn new techniques through AI collaboration

### For Live Performance
- Real-time visual synthesis controlled by movement
- Sensor-based music generation from dance
- Interactive installations responding to audience

---

## 🎯 Industry Implications

### Paradigm Shifts
1. **From Consumption to Generation:** Moving beyond AI recommendations to AI creating personalized content
2. **From Theft to Ownership:** Artists training on their own work solves copyright issues
3. **From Replacement to Augmentation:** AI as collaborative tool, not replacement
4. **From Generic to Specific:** Industry-specific tools rather than one-size-fits-all

### Challenges Addressed
- Copyright concerns through personal model training
- Creative industry's "click factory" manual processes
- Barrier to entry for new creators
- Need for massive content variations in gaming/media

---

## 📊 Results & Impact

### Productivity Metrics
- Philippe Hong: 7 complete songs in 3 weeks (vs. difficult 1/day goal)
- 40-60% reduction in routine task time
- 10,000+ hours of game music variations possible from single theme

### Creative Breakthroughs
- Non-musicians creating musical compositions
- Visual artists generating real-time responsive art
- Dancers becoming music creators through movement
- Cross-pollination between different art forms

---

## 🔮 Future Directions

### Technical Development
- More sophisticated personal model training tools
- Better integration with existing creative workflows
- Improved control and manipulation interfaces
- Cross-modal generation (movement→music→visuals)

### Community Growth
- More artistic residencies planned
- Wednesday presentation at SFU Surrey with live dancer
- Friday session at UBC emerging media lab
- Ongoing workshops and demonstrations

### Philosophical Evolution
- Redefining authorship in AI-assisted creation
- Establishing new copyright frameworks
- Building trust in AI tools through transparency
- Preserving human creativity while embracing automation

## 💬 Notable Quotes

> "The problem with AI, as it relates to art, is that it's trained on everybody else's stolen shit... But there's a next level where artists train an AI model on just their own work." - Kris Krüg

> "People think AI is cheating, it's less work. In fact, when you look at people working with AI, it's a lot more work." - [[Philippe Pasquier]]

> "I don't really consider myself as a musician because I'm doing music with numbers and algorithms... It's more like I manipulate numbers, creating textures." - Quentin Nolo

> "Sometimes you want to change in the middle of your song... it's a way to make a transition." - Philippe Hong on AI's practical studio applications

## 🎭 The Big Picture

This showcase demonstrated that AI in creative fields isn't about replacing artists but about:
- **Amplifying** individual creative voices
- **Democratizing** access to sophisticated production tools
- **Preserving** ownership and artistic integrity
- **Bridging** different creative mediums
- **Accelerating** production while maintaining quality

The residency model proves that artist-engaged AI development leads to tools that serve real creative needs while respecting intellectual property and artistic ownership.
