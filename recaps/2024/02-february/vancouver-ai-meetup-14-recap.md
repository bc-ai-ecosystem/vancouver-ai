## Technology Ethics Frameworks

### Brain-Computer Interface Ethics (Dr. Judy Ellis)

**Core Principles:**
- **Responsibility** accompanies possibility
- **Humility** in innovation and design
- **Human intuition** as override for AI algorithm outputs
- **Transparency** about capabilities and limitations

**Critical Concerns:**
- **Social Media Recruitment:** Neuralink using Twitter/X to recruit patients without traditional ethics oversight
- **Regulatory Gaps:** Private companies avoiding academic ethics board requirements
- **Consent Process:** Traditional forms "too long and laborious" but social media recruitment "equally concerning"

**Historical Warning:** CT scan marketplace disaster (shopping mall scans, Mother's Day specials) demonstrating need for appropriate regulation.

**Canadian Advantage:** Less paranoid about mind control than US, more focused on practical healthcare applications.

### Open Source vs. Security Philosophy

**Kush's DeepSeek Advocacy:** UBC banning Chinese AI model while allowing OpenAI/Anthropic representing "xenophobia" rather than legitimate security concerns.

**Security Counter-Perspective:** Models failing security tests, encryption concerns, data protection issues requiring careful evaluation.

**Practical Resolution:** Use case-specific evaluation rather than blanket policies, emphasis on local model deployment when security critical.

**Mistral Impact Recognition:** December 2023 open-weight release fundamentally disrupting OpenAI/Anthropic IP advantage, forcing product-focused pivots.

### Digital Rights & Privacy Reality

**End-to-End Encryption Obsolescence:** Apple Intelligence making encryption "moot" through perception layer data collection.

**Convenience vs. Power:** "Every time you get convenience, you relinquish power" - invisible infrastructure (fulfillment centers, warehouses) enabling magic-like service delivery.

**Post-Snowden Reality:** Assumption that phone/cloud security is compromised requiring local alternatives when security truly matters.
