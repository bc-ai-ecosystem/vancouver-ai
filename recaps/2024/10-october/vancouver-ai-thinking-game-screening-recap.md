- Moral weight scales with computational sophistication
- No separate "consciousness substance" beyond information processing

### **Embodiment vs. Simulation Debate**
**Physical World Experience vs. Perfect Physics Models**

**Pro-Embodiment (Suzanne):**
- Can't simulate conscious agents without having them already
- Social intelligence requires real-world interaction
- Chicken-and-egg problem with simulation-only learning

**Simulation-Sufficient (Jason):**
- Third-person observation of social interactions may suffice
- Video training provides temporal dynamics and multimodal data
- Physical embodiment not necessarily required for world modeling

### **AGI Definition Complexity**
**What Are We Actually Building?**

**Desktop AGI vs. Physical AGI:**
- **Near-term (5-10 years):** Research assistant capable of any intellectual task
- **Long-term (>10 years):** Embodied systems matching human physical capabilities
- **Definition Dependency:** Timeline estimates vary wildly based on AGI scope

## 💬 Audience Engagement Highlights

### **Michael Fergusson - P(doom): 100%**
**"We've Already Ruined Society"**

Passionate intervention arguing that:
- Simple recommendation algorithms already destroyed political discourse
- Humans require "inaccurate" models of reality to function (abstractions, interfaces)
- AI systems trained on "accurate" models incompatible with human cognition
- Fundamental mismatch between human intuition and computational reality

**Core Concern:** We're building technology that defeats human intuitions, which are foundation of ethics and meaning-making.

### **Simon Howarth - Interface Design Philosophy**
**Transparency vs. Mimicry in Human-AI Interaction**

Critical questions about AI interface design:
- Should AI reveal its artificial nature or mimic human interaction?
- Why do people want to distinguish human from AI communication?
- Risk of bonding with synthetic personas (emotional manipulation concerns)
- Need for "antivirus" software to detect AI-generated content

### **Kai - Data Bias & Representation**
**P(doom): 44% - "Garbage In, Garbage Out"**

Highlighted systemic data bias issues:
- Genomic sequencing: 94% white participants → drugs designed for white people
- No "air-gapped humans" - all training data reflects existing biases
- Need for new data collection methodologies for equitable AI systems

### **Juan - Gaming & Purpose Discovery**
**AI's Limitations in Understanding Human Purpose**

Introduced game called "Purpose" that AI cannot successfully play:
- Designed to help humans discover personal purpose through deep questions
- AI consistently fails to understand the deeper layers of human motivation
- Potential as consciousness test for future AI systems
- Saturday night "Purpose Game" sessions with Vancouver community

### **Niels - Intent & Empathy in AI**
**P(doom): 5% - "I Enjoyed a Sunset Yesterday"**

Philosophical inquiry into AI agency:
- Role of intent in consciousness and human identity
- Empathy requiring shared experience
- Programming agents to mimic human intent vs. developing genuine agency

## 🏗️ Industry Insights

### **AlphaFold Impact Assessment**
**Revolutionary but Limited**

Jason's nuanced view of AlphaFold's true impact:
- **Singular Achievement:** Solved protein structure prediction
- **Practical Limitations:** Protein structure ≠ small molecule interaction prediction
- **Human Genome Parallel:** Breakthrough achievements take years to translate into practical applications
- **Drug Discovery Reality:** Experimental structures still preferred when available

### **Open Source vs. Commercial Tensions**
**The Viability Problem**

Both panelists acknowledged fundamental tension:
- **Public Good:** Open source enables transparency and safety verification
- **Business Reality:** Startups need IP protection for investor value
- **Academic Constraints:** Conference publication cycles drive incremental research
- **Industry Partnerships:** Big tech leverages university fair use rights for data scraping

## 🎯 Career Strategy Discussions

### **AI-Resistant Domains (Rapidly Shrinking)**
- **Human Emotional Connection:** Deep empathy and authentic relationship building
- **Regulatory Protected:** Jobs with legal barriers to AI implementation
- **Consciousness Research:** Limited training data, fundamental unknowns
