# Vancouver AI Community Meetup #23 - Comprehensive Recap

**Date:** November 26, 2025
**Location:** HR MacMillan Space Centre (Planetarium), Vancouver, BC
**Host:** Kris Krüg
**Event Number:** 23
**Theme:** Ethics Panel - "Portals Not Panels"
**Attendee Demographics:** ~60-70% first-timers, 30-40% BC + AI members
**Compiled:** November 27, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Meetup #23 marked a significant evolution in the Vancouver AI Community's engagement with ethics, sustainability, and accountability. The event featured an extensive Indigenous welcome from Squamish Nation Counselor Anthony Joseph (Isiléyu), a technical presentation on AI energy monitoring by Lionel Emba, a powerful testimony from voice actor Amanda Silvera whose voice was stolen, and a groundbreaking ethics panel moderated by Catherine Warren with Kay Tigo, Kevin Friel, and Liz Marshall.

**Key Takeaway:** The community is actively wrestling with the paradox of using AI tools while advocating for environmental justice, consent, and accountability - crystallized in Lionel's proposal for a "Token Savings Award" that inverts the consumption incentives of OpenAI's trillion-token award.

## 1. Indigenous Welcome: Anthony Joseph (Isiléyu)

### Cultural Teachings Shared

Anthony Joseph, Squamish Nation Counselor with the ancestral name Isiléyu, delivered an extensive welcome that went far beyond protocol into deep cultural teaching:

**On Ancestral Naming:**
> "To get an ancestral name, your elders would watch you and see how you carry yourself."

- Aunt Joy's name means "to weave" - she is a cedar and wool weaver
- Uncle Chester's name means "to have a tool" - he is a carver
- Names reflect observed qualities and actions

**On Technology Adoption:**
> "Ancestors didn't have chainsaws. But they would've used it if it was there."

Anthony shared his own AI journey - using Canva to create his council campaign pamphlet, demonstrating pragmatic indigenous adoption of new tools.

**On Resilience:**
> "Humor is what got us through the darkest of times and humor is what will continue to catch us."

**Personal Journey:**
- Returned to Squamish Valley in 2010
- Aunt Joy taught him to weave despite math background
- First tunic: diamond design front, chevron back
- Pursuing Master's in Squamish language
- Uses iPad Pro for language video projects

**Ceremony:**
- Eagle Song (Sparkle Solum from Salt Chuck Ball Baker)
- Teaching on eagle feathers carrying prayers to Creator
- Hand-raising as traditional thank you gesture

**Reconciliation:**
- Acknowledged Senakw development (Squamish Nation-owned)
- Called it a "reconcili-action piece"

## 3. WhatsApp AI: Energy Monitoring & Token Savings Award

### Lionel Emba's Presentation

**WhatsApp for Open Router:**
- Scrapes Open Router leaderboard (no API available)
- Integrates EcoLogits for carbon/water estimation
- Shows monthly gigawatts used, CO2 emissions, projected water usage
- Includes equivalency conversions (km in car, microwave hours, etc.)

**Google's Energy Report:**
- First holistic methodology published
- **0.24 watt hour per prompt**
- **5 drops of water per prompt**
- Problem: Per-prompt not comparable across providers (tokens are real unit)

**Open Source Under Attack:**
- **curl project:** 8x more vulnerability reports, only 5% legitimate (AI hallucinating bounties)
- **FFMPEG:** Google Big Sleep 90-day disclosure policy overwhelming underfunded maintainers
- Open source enables all transparency: "There would be no data on this matter otherwise"

**1 Trillion Token Equivalency:**
- 52,000 households daily energy use
- 3.5 million km driven in a car

### Token Savings Award Proposal

> "What if we turn this onto its head and actually created an award for saving tokens?"

**Concept:**
- Reward efficiency, not consumption
- Share methods that save 1M/10M/100M tokens
- Document and share findings with community
- "Not using less of AI, but make a more sober use of it"

**Business Logic:**
- "If you want to change the outcomes, you change the incentives"
- OpenAI's award gamifies consumption
- BC + AI could award efficiency instead

**Q&A Highlights:**
- Energy mix configurable in WhatsApp for Open Router
- Default: world electricity mix, can simulate by region
- Discussion on open vs closed AI privacy implications

## 4. AI Voice Rights: Amanda Silvera's Story & SOBIR

### The Violation

Amanda Silvera, voice of Psych to Go (12.9M YouTube subscribers), discovered her voice was cloned:

**Most Disturbing Case:**
> "A gentleman who was using my voice to pose as a young girl and lure older men in, posing as this young girl. And it was all live videos of these men. And my voice was being used to seduce them."

**Ongoing Issues:**
- Reddit threads sharing "Amanda Silvera voice model"
- DMCA takedowns ineffective (one down, five pop up)
- Clones behind paywalls and in private spaces
- Potential biometric security implications (voice banking)

### Legal Gray Area

> "I was hitting a wall when it came to my rights. I was hitting a wall when it came to how much of my voice is even mine."

- Even lawyers frustrated by unclear jurisdiction
- Extends to all biometric data: gait, likeness, corneas, retinas

### SOBIR Founded

**Society for Original Biometric Identity Rights:**
- Pushing for policy changes and legislature
- change.org petition to Minister Evan Solomon (5,300+ signatures)
- Seeking Lead Petition platform for government attention

**Key Insight:**
> "It's not AI that's doing this. It's people. It's people abusing something."

### Tech Solution Concept

Amanda seeking team for biometric protection technology:
- Senior ML engineers (voice/audio)
- Deepfake detection engineers
- Synthetic media identification
- Watermarking specialists
- Cloud architects (data sovereignty)
- Biometric cybersecurity engineers
- Policy and compliance technologists

### Connection Made

Sesson Ong (government relations) offered to connect Amanda with:
- BC + AI parliamentary secretary
- Lead Petition platform
- Policy maker engagement strategy

### Catherine Warren - Context Setting

**Background:**
- Former CEO, Vancouver Economic Commission
- Climate physics background
- Launched Edmonton Ethical AI Accelerator Fund
- 25 years at FanTrust (innovation/entertainment/economic development)

**Key Framing:**
- AI as "double-edged sword, or maybe even an AK-47"

**Edward Wilson Quote:**
> "The problem with humanity is that we have paleolithic emotions with medieval institutions and godlike technology."

**Key Statistics:**
- 5-second AI video = 3.4 million joules = 61 km e-bike = 1+ hour microwave
- By 2028: 326 TWh/year for AI = some countries' entire usage
- 326 TWh = 300 billion miles driven = 1,600 round trips Earth to Sun
- 1.5°C exceeded = 1 billion people facing water stress/desertification
- 14% of world's species at extinction risk
- Coral reefs decline 70-90%

**Core Argument:**
> "AI is built on theft."

**On Corporate Responsibility:**
> "Have corporations ever been intrinsically motivated to uphold human rights? Policy is one of the biggest ways to get corporations to actually do the right thing."

### Kevin Friel - Compute & GPU Monopoly

**The Problem:**
- Nvidia's 20-year lead on hardware/software
- $5 trillion elephant in the room
- Only game in town for GPU compute at scale

**Needed Revolution:**
- ARM-style disruption for GPU (like Apple Silicon did for CPU)
- Nvidia 4090: 500W vs Apple Silicon equivalent: 40W
- Canadian opportunity: Nortel, TeleSat, Blackberry precedent

**Proposed Solution: Compute Carbon Offset**
- Tax credit incentive for efficient computing reports
- Fiscal accountability for model choices
- "Fix it in pre" philosophy for compute

**Personal Context:**
- Wasn't working for 2 years before AI pivot
- "It came into my industry and kicked the fucking table over"

- By 2027: Data centers = 1.7 trillion gallons water/year
- Canada: 20% world's freshwater, only 7% renewable
- 36 Indigenous nations still without potable water

**CASK Framework:**
- **C**uriosity
- **A**wareness
- **S**kepticism
- **C**aution

**Resistance Models:**
- Georgia, Indianapolis, Virginia: moratoriums on new data centers
- "The resistance has arrived"
- "People have power. We have to remember that."

### Panel Discussion Highlights

**Topo (Computer Scientist, 1990s AI):**
> "We got lazy as developers... Back in the nineties, optimization was the key."

> "Design a new economic system... This is not a technology problem. It's not even a political problem, it's an economic problem."

**On Democratization:**
> "The Egyptian Pharaoh democratized pyramid building. I won't participate."

**Kris Krüg:**
> "I find my relationship with AI non-consensual."

> "It came into my industry and kicked the fucking table over, so I don't feel like I really got a choice."

**Sesson Ong:**
- Innovation through AI for climate solutions
- Example: Reto Labs - social media detoxification for athletes/celebrities

### Closing Statements

**Kay:**
> "Go to therapy, deal with your trauma. Can we get real about that?"

> "It boils down to consent. It boils down to control and compensation."

**Amanda:**
> "There has to be balance... We don't need to give up one or the other."

**Liz:**
> "Let's reinvigorate and not forget the movement, the human based movement to protect this place."

**Kevin:**
> "There's something very punk rock about having something that's staring you in the face and using that tool in and of itself to tell the stories."
