## Opening Ceremony: Indigenous Protocol & Land Acknowledgment

### Squamish Nation Welcome

**Anthony Joseph (Coast Salish, Squamish Nation Counselor)** delivered a powerful opening, introducing himself in Squamish language and sharing his ancestral name "Lea." Anthony emphasized that time is our greatest asset and the importance of open hearts and open minds when engaging with indigenous knowledge and ceremony.

**[[jonny williams]] (Squamish Nation Counselor)** - recently elected to Squamish Nation Council - introduced Anthony as his lifelong mentor and explained the significance of the "Yo Knight" role (lead singer) in their cultural practices. Both counselors performed the **Tto Solums Snowbird Song**, a traditional blessing and medicine song gifted by Lia Donna Billy.

**Key Cultural Teachings:**
- Ceremony creates container for meaningful work
- Witnesses become "human recorders" - responsible for sharing what they learn
- Time as sacred resource that cannot be reclaimed
- Songs carry blessing, medicine, and cultural continuity
- Land acknowledgment: Before Space Centre, before Kitsilano, before Vancouver - this was and is Squamish territory

**[[Kris Krüg]]'s Reflection:**
"When Anthony and Johnny comes up every month and starts singing, I know everything that happens next is gonna be okay. We're here. We made it, we're in the right place. Whoever showed up are the right people. Whatever happens tonight is the right stuff that's gonna happen."

## Rival Technologies Hackathon Grand Finale

### Eight-Month Journey: $10,000 in Prizes

**Dale (Rival Technologies - Design & Innovation Lead)** and **Julia (VP Customer Experience)** closed out their six-month partnership with Vancouver AI, reflecting on four rounds of data storytelling innovation:

**Round 1:** "Is a hot dog a sandwich?" - Explored curiosity and whimsy in data
**Round 2:** Canadian identity and national tension - Heavy questions, deep analysis
**Round 3:** AI's impact on BC - Community self-reflection
**Round 4:** Music and emotion - Universal connections through data

**Dale's Reflection:**
"We've seen artists connect with scientists. We've seen storytellers connect with filmmakers, musicians connect with engineers. We've seen what happens when creative technologists connect around a creative idea - not just competition, but collaboration."

### Round 4 Winners: Music Survey Storytelling

#### Grand Prize Winner ($2,500): Andre & Taras - "Ukrainian Mafia"
**Project:** Canadian Music DNA Platform

A fully functional AI-powered web application that:
- Takes users through personalized music questionnaire
- Assigns personas based on Canadian music survey data
- Provides music recommendations via YouTube integration
- Creates matchmaking opportunities based on musical taste
- Generates custom album concepts (with lyrics and songs) based on user profile

**Technology Stack:**
- Multiple AI APIs for text generation
- Data analytics and visualization
- Deployed to Vercel for public access
- Advanced persona classification system

**Andre's Story:**
PhD machine learning researcher who has been a core Vancouver AI volunteer since the beginning. Known for bringing new friends (the "Ukrainian Mafia") to every event and helping with setup/cleanup. Soft-spoken but drops amazing technical innovations consistently.

**Future Vision:**
Originally planned to enable users to generate complete custom music albums (10-15 songs with lyrics) in minutes without singing. Ran out of time but proved the core concept.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
"Andre, thank you for helping clean up, for setup, for bringing all your friends around, man... You're a PhD machine learning guy who's been just dropping amazing bombs on us since the very, very beginning. I'm very happy that you're here."

#### Second Place: [[Darby Yule]] - "Signals: The Future of Sound"
**Project:** Futures Method Prediction of 2030 Music Landscape

Used academic "futures method" (educated guessing from data patterns) to predict five music genres that will dominate in 2030:

1. **Hybrid Local Pop:** Euphoric with bruised breath-thin vocals, Amapiano heartbeat, soft pads, hand drums, sparse guitars - built for travel reels
2. **At-Core Velocity Worship:** Bright tight drums at 100 BPM, crackling claps, stuttering glitches - treadmill music for micro-fame
3. **Retro-Futurism Neon Ghosts:** Velvet vocals, analog bass, tape delay - tomorrow wearing yesterday's grin
4. **Lo-fi Therapy Pop:** Whispered lines under tape hiss, soft piano, gentle swells - healing or illusion of it

**Presentation Style:**
Featured "Dr. Veek" (AI character/cultural historian from 2225) analyzing each genre with sample tracks and AI-generated album artwork. Blended academic rigor with creative storytelling.

**Darby's Background:**
Former teenage rock star from Prince George, now UI/UX professional who took Kris's AI class 1.5 years ago. Previously won in Round 1 with Dr. Veek character. Described as "the Rick Rubin of our community" for creative intuition.

**On Generative Music as a Musician:**
"My punk rock heart wants everything to be strictly human. But musicians haven't even totally accepted synthesizers yet, and those are from the sixties. There's room for it. Technology isn't bad, it's just the way you use it."

#### Honorable Mention: Scott Larson - "Pixel Wizard"
**Project:** Metal Music Lens on Survey Data

Creative data interpretation through heavy metal aesthetic:
- Featured oldest respondent (92, Toronto, loves Tom Lehrer parodies)
- Highlighted youngest worker (18, tired from school and work)
- Showcased highest earners ($500K+)
- Found the person who "doesn't really listen to music" but took a music survey
- Narrated by character attending Dying Remains concert who pauses to analyze the data

**Scott's Reflection:**
"Music's a way that I wasted a huge part of my youth. So it's really easy for me to look through a thousand responses and see who the cool people are. If you're gonna look for outliers, who's a bigger outlier than the person who paints their face to go to a metal show?"

### Hall of Fame Induction: Prajwal ($1,000 Bonus Prize)

**The Legend:** Placed second in ALL FOUR hackathon rounds over 8 months

**Round 4 Project:** Plato AI - Philosophical Data Analysis
- Used Socratic dialogue (Socrates + Glaucon) to explore free-response survey questions
- System asks directional questions and provides philosophical analysis
- Citations to actual respondent quotes
- Vision: Transform into podcast-style audio content

**Prajwal's Circumstances:**
- 18 years old, high school valedictorian, now attending Langara College
- Currently unhirable (immigration status)
- Created Round 4 submission during midterms with only 4 hours available
- Submitted 30 minutes past deadline at midnight
- Recorded video while exhausted ("sorry for blinking")

**[[Kris Krüg]]'s Arc Assessment:**
"Prajwal's story arc has gone from rule-following high schooler at the beginning to independently inventing vibe coding in his own head. He's like, 'oh man, this vibe coding thing, I don't have to worry so much about the code, just focus on user experience.' Yeah, we got our own little Andrej Karpathy here... To submit an unfinished project, a shower thought - probably on the edge of what you usually turn in. Welcome to the Hall of Fame."

**Prajwal's Reflection:**
"I like coding and vibe coding in general, just building these kinds of products. It's kind of my jam. Even though it feels like I'm sacrificing my time, I really, really enjoy building them."

**Community Note:**
Multiple people trying to hire Prajwal. He's one of the smartest in the community. Also mentors at Ethos Labs teaching prompting and context to black youth.

## First Annual AI Film Festival

### Vision & Launch

**[[Kevin Friel]] (Pixel Wizard/Prompt Goblin)** inaugurated Vancouver AI's First Annual AI Film Festival, gathering local, national, and international creators to showcase the rapid evolution of AI filmmaking.

**Kevin's Opening:**
"It's a transformative time once again. We thought, what better way to showcase the rapid change - often daily, sometimes multiple times a day - than to put a spotlight on our local, our national and our international friends and neighbors of creators, both new and experienced."

### Film Screening Highlights

**Films Shown:**
1. Horror short with graveyard scene and practical AI effects
2. Romantic comedy featuring someone talking to a leaf pile
3. Philosophical farm piece exploring consciousness and purpose
4. Lucid dreaming narrative about losing control between worlds
5. **"Critical Seduction: Darlings"** - D&D comedy by Luke (featured in panel)
6. Roach infestation horror testimonial

### International Panel: The State of AI Filmmaking

**Bay Rate (Visual Effects Legend)**
- Created Gollum's face for Lord of the Rings ("that's literally his face shape")
- Cut scenes for all Valve Half-Life games
- Stints at Pixar
- Now: Storytelling Yoda at undisclosed company with [[Kevin Friel]]

**Bay's Vision:**
"It's all about empowering the individual. This allows us as creatives to express ourselves very fully. You're able to bring your vision to life. I hope this technology can open the door for Canadian filmmakers to make bigger things and get their ideas out in ways we never had the chance before.

One great advantage is exploring almost any idea, any visual style for very little money. As you go into the unknown and make a human contribution, you carry it from cliché into something unique, original and compelling.

I had a project that sat on the shelf for 23 years. One of the great benefits of AI filmmaking is dragging those scripts out of the dust bin and seeing if I can get them going again."

**Ryan Patterson (Director - Grail, TIFF Premiere)**
"An opportunity for Canadians is that we have people already in film and television - very creative people with unique perspectives. That's super exciting.

Quick story: I know someone who comes to our Toronto AI filmmaking meetups. He submitted a beautiful short film for 48-hour film fest. He ended up in top 10-20 for his film 'Where Did You Go To Earth School?' He said, 'I just like film. I love movies, love stories.' That's impactful because it shows someone who is a storyteller - maybe he wasn't sure he even knew that - but it's giving an opportunity for a lot more people to share their perspective."

**Elvis Dean (20-Year Veteran Animator, Toronto)**
"If we can get to a place where technology allows actors, directors, and artists who traditionally worked on film to use this to tell bigger stories or more in-depth stories by lowering budgets or giving more scope - that's a huge opportunity for human creativity."

**N Ek (Lighthouse AI Workshops)**
"People are starting to stand up way more and take leadership positions. Pioneer this technology. Build a standard and precedent in my industry on how this should be used. I hope you join us. Join the transformation and the initiative. It'll be a beautiful world if people keep creating beautiful things."

**[[Michael Tippett]]**
"As a Canadian, everyone has that unique perspective. There is such beautiful diversity in Canada. I'm confident these tools will empower people to share that unique perspective - not just within Canada but worldwide."

### Live Panel: Luke & Tim - The Practitioner's Perspective

#### Luke: From Billion Views to Three-Day Solo Productions

**Background:**
- Knew he wanted to be animator at age 12 (Jurassic Park in theaters)
- First animation job at 17
- Directing by age 21 (2001)
- 24 years of directing experience
- More than a billion views across career
- "Did way too much Barbie, honestly"
- Pitched multiple shows to broadcasters - never got greenlit

**The Breakthrough:**
"In the past few months, it's gotten to the point where you can actually produce studio quality production where you almost can't tell it's AI. It's a completely different process though. That two-minute animation I did? I did that in three days from script to final edit, which is just unheard of."

**The Economics:**
"I worked on Kraft Dinner's Cheese-asaurus Rex commercial with a big team. One of those spots cost between $200,000-$400,000 depending on complexity - big team, months of work for a 30-second spot. And I just did two minutes in three days by myself."

**The Process:**
"I think I'm maybe a little OCD, which helps - really obsessive with making things perfect. It's a mix of AI. I'll bring stuff into Photoshop a lot. I do hundreds of generations. I spent over a hundred dollars in credits on that two-minute piece because I did so many generations until I got the right acting, the right performance. Even then, I'm not quite happy with a few shots because comedy timing is really everything."

**On Iteration & Happy Accidents:**
"One interesting thing I really love is the amount of iteration. You can try so many different things so quickly. You also get some happy mistakes sometimes. It's very different - a big paradigm shift from traditional production. It's like having a co-director that is really weird and just does random shit. But like, cool weird. Sometimes cool, productive weird. 90% of the time it's unusable. But 10% of the time you get some real gold.

Like after Violet says 'and healing potions' - that facial expression, I just loved that. I didn't prompt that. It just came and I was like, oh, this is great, gonna keep that in."

**On Tools:**
"The best part is iteration. You get so much to choose from. You just would never be able to do that before. You're able to get something that feels less polished but more human and natural in some ways. There are still some things not quite feeling human - certain nuances I think will get better. Shout out to Seed Dream/Sea Dance - really good at this stuff. When they release their voice model later, that's gonna be really cool."

**On Collaborative AI Filmmaking:**
"I've actually been actively working on putting together a pipeline for working collaboratively with other artists because there are bigger projects we're pitching - some indigenous animation series and stuff. One person can't do a series, can't do a movie. We're looking into longer format and how that works because it's a completely different paradigm.

You don't really need to board, you can jump right into an animatic with Nano Banana. There's a lot of really different things and it's a bit of wild west right now. A lot of different people in different places kind of putting together these processes that are working. We're throwing it on Reddit like 'oh, I'm trying this' and talking with each other - have you tried this?

A lot of us are figuring it out and the tools are changing so quickly. Almost every week something new comes out and you're like 'oh, sometimes the process I just perfected last week is done and I don't need to do that anymore.' So a lot of constant weekly paradigm shifts."

**Tiny Go Studios Training Initiative:**
"I have a lot of friends in the animation industry. People on my last team - one's now a massage therapist, one's an executive assistant, one is working at Staples. It's a really hard industry right now.

One of the things Tiny Go Studios is launching (not sure when yet, still working on it) is a school where we're teaching people how to transfer animation skills to using them for AI. We are actively building a studio that's ambitiously doing more than just shorts - looking at actual series that will be on TV and movies.

There is no way to train ethically in the traditional sense right now. But this is an opportunity to highlight underrepresented voices in a way that was impossible before. You could not get buy-in because gatekeepers were traditionally white male. This is really important to us - uplifting marginalized voices, specifically queer voices, indigenous voices, and BIPOC voices. That's something we're pushing forward.

As far as getting enough control out of AI to give your own story, to tell it the way you want - it comes down to involving indigenous storytellers, period. That's it."

#### Tim: VFX Compositor Exploring New Frontiers

**Background:**
- VFX industry compositor and lighter
- Works on shop-by-shop basis
- Now specializing in immersive technology/XR
- Teaching Comfy UI + Nuke workflows on CG Pro

**On Comfy UI & Experimentation:**
"In terms of Comfy UI, it's more exploration at this point. There's a lot of - as you mentioned, final pixel - things aren't really getting to final pixel yet. But in terms of implementing Comfy UI and AI, it's experimentation. You have people who understand what they do, understand animation, understand how to make a good shot, comedic timing. That's what we need more. We need people who understand what they're bringing and how to get that out of AI."

**On VFX Complexity:**
"There's things in what we do - I don't know if many of you understand how shots are composited and built, but it's super complex. There's so many layers, so much data coming in. To say AI is gonna take over VFX - but like what part of it? There's so many different things going on. There's CG, there's matching plates, there's color, there's all this stuff.

People get really scared that AI can do all this stuff. AI can do it - but you gotta apply it to the task you're trying to do. Right now we're finding it's not necessarily faster. It might be around the same. It might be faster for someone who's actually an expert in the field to do it already."

**On Previsualization:**
"Right now I find, especially with immersive technology and doing that stuff, we're experimenting on how to get this stuff implemented in a way that's gonna be useful. We're finding previsualization is big. Getting your idea out there - that's where it's becoming very fast.

I just came off a project where we used it for simple storyboarding to get an idea to a director and show them - we were under a 20-day deadline for a massive two-minute project. To quickly conceptualize what you're trying to put forward. AI in that way is more powerful at the moment in previsualization than final pixel. But then you have big studios with tech teams building crazy tools or acquiring them."

**On Nano & Control:**
"I made that short before any of this stuff came out - Nano, flex context. But now you have the ability literally - I could make a first frame then take my character and say make them smirk, make them smile with big teeth, turn their head to the right, turn their head to the left, put their hand up in a gesture. You're constantly able to manipulate this character in the shot with minimal degradation to the data or image.

In this new short I'm working on, I'm able to go in and be like 'okay, this character's in the bedroom now, can you put this character in the bathroom in similar decor?' And then I have another shot where the same character's in a different room in the house. You can kind of build out continuity throughout a whole sequence just by being like 'can you put this character here now? Can you put them there? Can they be wearing this?' You can feed in multiple images - this dress, these pants - and you can modify just that one part of a shot.

For creative-minded people, it's not a lottery or slot machine anymore pulling and getting a result. Now it's more like you have control over sort of everything you wanna build."

**On Vibe Coding:**
"I'm big into vibe coding and building tools. It's another one of my passions. I love doing that stuff, helping artists. Something before that would take me weeks to do, I can go and build like an app to make a very simple Comfy UI where you connect nodes and import these APIs to make images - you can do that by yourself in a day. It's crazy. Not something I would release to a company and put out there, but it's the idea that you can actually put that stuff together.

The whole culmination of the creative and the tech and all these people embracing the technology is where you start to get these new ideas and workflows. It's hard right now to figure out how to build something around this, but it's a new frontier."

**[[Kevin Friel]] on The Paradigm Shift:**
"The cone of efficacy of intention is narrowing with each new model release. And that's what's really, really exciting about all of this. The quality of character animation in Luke's piece - that is in the Dreamworks animation ballpark. That isn't coming out of every AI animator right now. That's not randomly coming out of Sora. How much do you attribute your eye and your experience in traditional flows into really finessing that kind of acuity?"

"As much as we are trying to escape the perils of a linear visual effects workflow that looks like an assembly line with a few hops, it's really becoming circular now. You've got a first frame and you're gonna take that into Nano - maybe you generated that in a combination of Midjourney or Sea Dance. It's all sort of circular now. That whole process that is infinitely manipulable, working in the edit now - the storytelling is what the edit tells you at every stage."

### Audience Q&A: The Hard Questions

#### Question on Industry Transition

**Audience Member:**
"I have a lot of friends who work in the industry - actors, animators, various people - and they're hurting right now because the industry is hard. There's a lot of hope I see on the stage, especially in the idea of a thousand iterations until I see the thing that actually works, and it's still not quite right. I feel like what we have in BC is discernment about what's good and the ability to harness these tools to actually create. But there's such great fear and reluctance to step into it because people feel like 'well, this is replacing me.' How do we bridge that gap? How do we bring people into the fold so that we can harness this expertise we've cultivated and capitalize on this what's almost there to be brilliant?"

**[[Kevin Friel]]'s Response:**
"You have exemplified precisely what I wanted to hope to showcase here tonight. These two guys and myself, we all come from professional visual effects animation background. We were all in really big teams doing very specific jobs in the line. To pivot over to another job in that line was really, really hard, if not borderline impossible.

What I see is those people that were cogs in the storytelling wheel are getting to have bigger ownership of stories now. I think there's a really amazing opportunity to take the existing skill sets and experiences we all have and convert into vibrant multiple pegs of the economy with unbeatable IP. Once that gets a groundswell of movement through the industry and through online appetite of 'oh, there's real stories coming out of here,' individual studios with followings, with Twitch streams of them jamming on Comfy UI one night and seeing what pops out of the hot GPUs."

**Luke's Response:**
"Another initiative - I have a lot of friends in the animation industry. People on my last team: one's now a massage therapist, one's an executive assistant, one is working at Staples. It's a really hard industry right now.

One of the things Tiny Go Studios is launching is a school teaching people how to transfer animation skills to using them for AI. We are actively building a studio doing more than just shorts - looking at actual series on TV and movies.

I lived through the early 2000s when the whole change happened from hand-drawn to 3D animation, Toon Boom and Flash. So many people got left behind. But eventually a lot of them did come over and retrain and were able to do that. That's what we need to happen now.

One weird thing is there's so much ethical resistance against AI. But if you want a job... I'm excited about it. I love it because I get to be so much more creative and I wanna share that love with others as well."

#### The IP & Ethics Debate

**Audience Member (Color Science Technician):**
"I work in film industry on technical color side. I've been noticing people - back in 2021, I had friends serving tables who became editors because there weren't enough people. Nowadays it's quite the opposite. What I've been hearing for people asking what do I do to break into industry - I started getting into Curious Refuge. Just to be able to come from a technical standpoint where you're consistently looking at data and transitioning into creative ideas just like you guys do. The resistance that's supposed to happen - I think what I've been hearing is share the word, try to make it simple. There's a period of resistance, a period of going down with what used to be, but this is going fast. The more we get used to it... Comfy UI to me is like 'oh my God, I have to learn Nuke again, Jesus Christ.' But kudos to you guys. Spread the word."

**Audience Question on Training Data & Theft:**
"I put an image I created with AI on my Facebook feed and got a lot of reactions. One woman from the states wrote 'AI is all about theft and lying' and kept explaining that, warning me to be careful because people won't want to work with me because I'm using AI.

When it comes to what you guys are doing, how much do you feel that what comes on the screen when you prompt the AI is actually taking someone else's work and becomes yours?"

**[[Kevin Friel]]'s Response:**
"That is a great question. That is the heart of the matter in so many ways. It really is. That is something we are all wrestling with right now in very big and serious ways.

The legacy of models dominantly being used have hoovered everything off the internet, off Art Station, off artists' looks and history and everything. That is so hard to move through right now. We confront ourselves - I think you guys share the same values. It's a technology that has come so quickly and has been unveiled with consequences not kept into consideration. But here we are and that paradigm has shifted.

What I am hopeful for is proliferation of new ethically trained models. So consensually trained - that means anyone in Moon Valley or Adobe Firefly (they just had a big new update this week at Adobe Max that actually makes that model production usable again in terms of quality, 'cause it had fallen behind) - everyone has given consent in those models. We're getting there. But we have a legacy that is like ugh, and we need to clean up. And I confront myself daily with that."

**[[Kris Krüg]] on [[Philippe Pasquier]]:**
"[[Philippe Pasquier]] at SFU SIAT - his whole jam is training small models on artists' work. I have trained photographic models on only portraits I've ever taken and I'm able to generate now new faces based on this. These models are available to these guys as well. I am not trying to dodge the question by saying the people here are exploring alternative methods for dealing with this type of stuff. This stuff matters to us a lot. We confront it every day in our work.

Everything generated now is slurped up but my particular photos have been trained into models more than anybody else I know. There's a website haveibeentrained.com where you can look at your own work. I've got like 2000 photos in the NVIDIA facial recognition dataset used in all sorts of activities. That is a foundational model. It is crazy."

**Audience Member (Susan - UBC Center for Migration Studies):**
"I work as a cultural facilitator with UBC Center for Migration Studies. This past year we used AI (just ChatGPT) to create a script from storytelling of two indigenous elders. One was hereditary chief of Musqueam Village where we're all gathering today. We were able to reproduce the Musqueam village before forced displacement. We screened the film at Museum of Vancouver upstairs. We produced the village, did photogrammetry of the elders, did their mocap. It was very fun. Now their grandchildren can make video games with them if they want.

Understanding that ethics around AI don't necessarily account for cultural intellectual property - what are the steps you suggest if you've worked with indigenous communities before to have a more relational and reciprocal approach?"

**Luke's Response:**
"One of the great things about AI people aren't talking about, I think, is because we can create things for so much cheaper and because gatekeepers have traditionally been white male, this is an opportunity to highlight underrepresented voices in a way that was just impossible before. You could not get buy-in because there wasn't - 'oh well, I'm afraid my little white son isn't gonna see himself in all these indigenous people over here.'

This is something really important to us in our studio - uplifting marginalized voices, specifically queer voices, indigenous voices, and BIPOC voices. That's something we're pushing forward. As far as you can get enough control out of AI to give your own story, to tell it the way you want to tell it - it comes down to involving indigenous storytellers, period. That's it."

**Karu (Audience Member) - The Radical Take:**
"There is no way to train ethically trained models. That's bullshit. Everyone who owns data - Shutterstock, all these companies going around saying 'oh hey, we got ethically trained models' - you know what they're doing? They're saying all the photographers that ever uploaded photos to our platform, we have the license. Go pound sand, these are ours now, we own. So that is not ethically trained fucking models. That's them saying we got you by the balls again.

I think we have to give up the idea of IP and trademark and all this other stuff to ever enter the true age of AI. If you're gonna try and attach to the micro-remuneration idea, it is not gonna work. There is no latent space true connection. I just feel like that's not the place. I think we have to truly say this is the next step or another step in a different medium of filmmaking.

My question was gonna be - you keep saying I asked the model, I begged the model it generates. I don't feel that's true. I feel like most of it is like here's the character control net, here's the lighting control net. I feel like that's what you guys are doing 'cause the consistency I'm seeing seems much beyond begging the model."

**Response from Panel:**
"It's a little bit of both. We are in that wobbly quantum theoretical space where both can be true right now. And we have to see what resolves. In terms of you can put in references and the models are just getting better at coherency. That is giving us consistency now from a prompt. A lot of my stuff I'm not using reference images for right now. It's pure consistency of prompting. Claude is really helping me with that. The model just keeps that in context with whichever job you're doing now. That's where consistency is coming from."

**[[Kevin Friel]] Final Thoughts:**
"I would not be here without Curious Refuge. I took one of their courses in their early days. That's what got my feet wet. Their community is inspiring our community here. This is the first of hopefully a monthly offshoot of AI film in particular - to create community, have these conversations, deep dive into latest and greatest, bring creators together whether brand new or really experienced. We want everyone in the same melting pot bouncing off each other and raising everything. 'Cause it's more important to do that than ever."

## Community Announcements & Growth

### Surrey AI Networking Events

**Emar & [[Matthew Schwartzman]]** promoted Surrey AI meetups as accessible alternative for those in Maple Ridge and outlying areas who find Vancouver meetups too far. They do daily pushups to stay in shape for hosting events (demonstrated live on stage). Secret discount codes available for attendees.

**[[Kris Krüg]]'s Appreciation:**
"In two minutes you're gonna see opportunity to donate to youth of our community, and that's what we're talking about right there. Prajwal, Ethos, Emar, [[Matthew Schwartzman]] - they hold us up. Thanks for representing out in Surrey. Matthew, thank you for the walkthrough video today of the new venue."

### ByteDance Corporate Partnership

**Karu (ByteDance Product Manager, Tokyo)** - flew in from Tokyo for second consecutive month, joined BC + AI as corporate partner bringing five people.

**Karu's Perspective:**
"The reason I chose this community is seeing the atmosphere in United States versus Canada. Canada is a wonderful location I have never been. I found out this is really not a melting pot - each individual culture still exists. That's one key point I felt, and I love this country really.

There were a lot of concerns about AI - good things about AI. When we started from internet, everybody used it without constraints or doubt. But everybody's worried about IP, personal information. The internet was the same thing. I am in a Chinese company but it's a Singapore entity I'm located and working in. Everybody thinks about ByteDance, TikTok. But we actually been really secure on protecting data that's not gonna be shared on our models, but other models that exist right now, you have to disable it or they're gonna keep learning the models.

Why I'm here today is I will be able to help out whatever things you have concerns or things you want to do, because it's about controlling AI, not using it. If you have money, if you control your money, you'll have great life. If you lose control of your money, you'll have bad situation. That's one thing I feel about AI - you control it, you'll have successful situation in your life.

I do think about IP stuff, but there's other community globally I've been talking to - film industries, individual photos, all these kind of stuff. I think those might be protecting halfway, but some things have to be released. I see that already happening globally. I'll be open to talk about anything you want about global, China, Japan, anything. I really gonna be participating a lot more. I love everyone here, especially Kris Krüg and all people in this community."

**Partnership Plans:**
Working on video/photo generative hackathon for spring 2026.

### Education + AI Special Interest Group

**Maya Arnold** promoted Education + AI meetups at Ethos Labs - third meetup coming soon. "These things we're doing tonight are fun and energizing, but the real work happens in small groups."

### Mind, AI & Consciousness Group

**David (speaking for Loki):**
"Mind AI and Consciousness. We're a bunch of eclectic folks who like to talk about the human side of AI. In other words, what's it like to be conscious? We've been wrestling with these ideas for 2000 years. We have new tools in form of computer AI to help us probe or understand some of these phenomena. We have a topic once a month. We read, we meet, we talk. It's a great lot of fun."

**Kris on David's Work:**
"David built the BC + AI website that a lot of you guys became members on. He's building this other Mind AI Consciousness website (mac.bcai.ca) that synchronizes our different group chats with deep discussion. He's building an AI agent that's trained on all these private group chats inside the Mind AI Consciousness group. It's quite amazing - if you join the group lately, you can just be like 'Hey, what are we talking about? What's going on? What is David thinking about? What's the consensus on these things?'"

### BC + AI Nonprofit Membership Drive

**[[Kris Krüg]]'s Call to Action:**
"Out of this whole community has sprung a nonprofit. Many of you guys are members. I'd like for the rest of you to join. If you like Matthew or Emar or the youthful thing we got going on here, we give scholarships all the time. People come here for free. They go to meetups for free.

Hackathons we sponsored - Ubada, are you here? Ubada has won five hackathons in the last two months, including a couple we've sent him to recently. He's crushing the scene. He's getting flown to France because of the last hackathon win we sent him to, to represent Canadian Oceans internationally.

Those of you who are not part of this whole situation - to join up costs $240 for the year. It means you're part of this community. There's a bunch of perks I'll tell you about them another time, but really it's being part of this whole vibe and crew. Thank you. There's donuts in the lobby. We've got an hour left before we have to go."

## Key Themes & Insights

### The Economics of Democratization

**Traditional Animation Costs:**
- 30-second Kraft Dinner commercial: $200,000-$400,000
- Big team, months of work
- Multiple specialists in pipeline

**AI Animation Costs:**
- 2-minute short: $100 in credits
- 3 days from script to final
- Solo creator with aesthetic control

**Impact:**
- Gatekeepers losing power over whose stories get told
- Marginalized voices gaining production capability
- Professional animators pivoting from specialist to storyteller-owner
- "Individual studios" emerging with personal followings

### The Craft vs. Control Debate

**Old Paradigm:**
- Team-based specialization
- Linear pipeline (concept → board → model → animate → composite → final)
- High barriers to entry
- Established quality standards

**New Paradigm:**
- Circular workflows (first frame → Nano → Photoshop → back to Nano → edit → repeat)
- Individual ownership with collaborative possibility
- Experimentation through iteration (hundreds of generations)
- "Co-director that is really weird" - 90% unusable, 10% gold
- Context windows and prompt consistency replacing technical precision

**Key Insight from Tim:**
"For creative-minded people, it's not a lottery or slot machine anymore pulling and getting a result. Now it's more like you have control over everything you wanna build."

### The Ethics Labyrinth

**Current Reality:**
- All major models trained on scraped data (Art Station, photos, videos)
- Artists' work included without consent or compensation
- Shutterstock/Getty claiming ownership of user uploads for training
- "Have I Been Trained" reveals extent (e.g., Kris has 2000 photos in NVIDIA facial recognition dataset)

**Emerging Approaches:**
1. **Consensual Models:** Moon Valley, Adobe Firefly (contributors opted in)
2. **Custom Training:** [[Philippe Pasquier]]'s work at SFU training small models on individual artist portfolios
3. **Indigenous Protocol:** Involving indigenous storytellers directly, respecting cultural IP
4. **Radical Acceptance:** "Give up the idea of IP and trademark to enter the true age of AI" (Karu)

**Unresolved Tension:**
The community is wrestling with benefiting from tools built on problematic foundations while building toward more ethical alternatives. No clear consensus, just confronting the reality daily.

### Indigenous Knowledge & AI Intersection

**Key Principles Shared:**
1. Ceremony creates container for meaningful work
2. Witnesses have responsibility to share what they learn
3. Time as sacred, non-renewable resource
4. Cultural protocols must be respected
5. Indigenous storytellers must be directly involved (not just consulted)

**UBC Project Example:**
- Recreated Musqueam village before forced displacement
- Used ChatGPT for script from elder storytelling
- Photogrammetry and mocap of elders
- Grandchildren can now make video games with ancestors
- Screened at Museum of Vancouver

**Luke's Framing:**
"This is an opportunity to highlight underrepresented voices in a way that was impossible before. You could not get buy-in because gatekeepers were traditionally white male. This is something really important to us - uplifting marginalized voices. It comes down to involving indigenous storytellers, period. That's it."

### Youth Empowerment Through Technology

**Prajwal's Story:**
- 18 years old, high school valedictorian
- Now at Langara College, dealing with immigration status
- Placed second in all four hackathon rounds over 8 months
- Independently discovered "vibe coding" philosophy
- Mentors at Ethos Labs teaching prompting to black youth
- Multiple people trying to hire him
- $1,000 Hall of Fame prize winner

**[[Matthew Schwartzman]] & Emar:**
- Running Surrey AI meetups
- Making AI accessible outside Vancouver core
- Creating pathways for youth in outlying areas

**Ubada:**
- Won five hackathons in two months
- Sent by BC + AI nonprofit to international competitions
- Getting flown to France to represent Canadian Oceans
- Scholarship recipient

**Pattern:**
Community investing in youth through scholarships, mentorship, and competition support. Youth reciprocating through volunteering, teaching, and bringing fresh perspectives.

### Industry Transformation Realities

**Animation/VFX Crisis:**
- Massive layoffs across industry
- Luke's former team: massage therapist, executive assistant, Staples employee
- "It's a really hard industry right now"
- 2021: Servers became editors due to worker shortage
- 2025: Opposite problem - too many workers, too few jobs

**Historical Parallel:**
- Early 2000s: Hand-drawn to 3D/Flash transition
- Many left behind, but many retrained successfully
- Current transition: Team specialists to individual creator-owners
- Same fear, same resistance, same eventual adoption pattern

**Emerging Solutions:**
1. **Tiny Go Studios Training Program:** Teaching animation skills → AI skills transfer
2. **Curious Refuge Courses:** Community learning from established programs
3. **Monthly AI Film Meetups:** Knowledge sharing, tool discovery, collaboration
4. **Vibe Coding Philosophy:** Focus on user experience over technical implementation
5. **Previsualization Focus:** Using AI for concept work in existing pipelines

### Tools Shaping the Landscape

**Mentioned by Name:**
- **Comfy UI:** Complex node-based system ("like learning Nuke again")
- **Nano/Banana:** Video generation with control (first frame → manipulate character)
- **Sea Dream/Sea Dance:** Strong performance on character animation
- **Moon Valley:** Consensually trained model
- **Adobe Firefly:** Consensually trained, recent major update (Adobe Max)
- **Control Nets:** Character, lighting, composition control
- **Claude:** Helping with prompt consistency and context management
- **Cursor:** Vibe coding, rapid tool building
- **Runway, Luma:** Video generation (various applications)

**Workflow Evolution:**
Week-by-week paradigm shifts as new tools emerge. Processes perfected one week become obsolete the next. Community adapting through sharing (Reddit, meetups, private chats).

### The Canadian Opportunity

**Unique Positioning:**
1. **Existing Talent Pool:** Olympic Village full of animation/VFX professionals
2. **Cultural Diversity:** "Not a melting pot - each culture still exists" (Karu)
3. **Storytelling Tradition:** Strong film/TV production infrastructure
4. **Creative Perspectives:** Unique voices waiting to be amplified
5. **Lower Barriers:** AI tools enabling bigger stories with smaller budgets

**Risk:**
Trained professionals displaced by AI might leave industry entirely before retraining becomes accessible. Window of opportunity to capture and redirect this talent through community-led education.

**Bay Rate's Vision:**
"I hope this technology can open the door for Canadian filmmakers to make bigger things and get their ideas out in ways we never had the chance before."

## Standout Quotes

**Anthony Joseph:**
"Time is our greatest asset, and that's the one thing you can't get back no matter where you spend it."

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
"When Anthony and Johnny comes up every month and starts singing, I know everything that happens next is gonna be okay."

**[[Darby Yule]]:**
"My punk rock heart wants everything to be strictly human. But musicians haven't even totally accepted synthesizers yet, and those are from the sixties."

**Luke:**
"It's like having a co-director that is really weird and just does random shit. But like, cool weird. 90% of the time it's unusable. But 10% of the time you get some real gold."

**Bay Rate:**
"As you go into the unknown and make a human contribution, you carry it from just being a cliche into something unique, original and compelling."

**Prajwal:**
"I like coding and vibe coding in general, just building these kinds of products. It's kind of my jam. Even though it feels like I'm sacrificing my time, I really, really enjoy building them."

**[[Kevin Friel]]:**
"The cone of efficacy of intention is narrowing with each new model release. And that's what's really, really exciting about all of this."

**Karu:**
"It's about controlling AI, not using it. If you control your money, you'll have great life. If you lose control of your money, you'll have bad situation. Same with AI."

**Susan (UBC):**
"Now their grandchildren can make video games with them [ancestors] if they want."

**Audience Member:**
"The more we get used to it... Comfy UI to me is like 'oh my God, I have to learn Nuke again, Jesus Christ.'"

**Audience Dissent:**
"There is no way to train ethically trained models. That's bullshit. I think we have to give up the idea of IP and trademark to ever enter the true age of AI."

## Conclusion

Vancouver AI Meetup #22 marked a turning point for the community - the moment when AI filmmaking graduated from experimental curiosity to production-ready craft. With Hollywood VFX legends like Bay Rate validating the technology, local practitioners like Luke and Tim demonstrating three-day workflows replacing $300K productions, and youth like Prajwal proving that 18-year-olds can compete at the highest levels, the community is no longer speculating about AI's impact on creative industries.

They're living it.

The Rival hackathon finale demonstrated that data storytelling has evolved beyond novelty into art form. The indigenous ceremony grounded everything in place, protocol, and ancestral responsibility. The heated debates about IP and ethics showed a community wrestling with real consequences rather than abstract concerns.

Most importantly, the meetup revealed a community investing in its youth (scholarships, mentorship, international competition support) while creating pathways for displaced professionals to reinvent themselves as storyteller-owners rather than specialized cogs in industrial pipelines.

The First Annual AI Film Festival isn't just a clever branding move - it's a flag in the ground declaring Vancouver's intention to lead in this transformation. With ByteDance partnerships forming, training programs launching, indigenous collaborations beginning, and monthly film showcases building momentum, BC + AI is positioning itself as the place where AI creative work gets serious.

As [[Kevin Friel]] said: "We want everyone in the same melting pot bouncing off each other and raising everything. 'Cause it's more important to do that than ever."
