## Technical Deep Dives

### Lionel Ring's WhatsApp Energy Monitoring Project

**The Problem:**
- AI is ubiquitous and energy-intensive but has zero reporting on energy usage
- 55% of AI requests in coding environments are never used (wasted due to UX patterns)  
- Energy demand likely going parabolic without measurement tools

**The Solution:**
- Built Visual Studio Code extension measuring real-time AI energy usage
- Created dashboard showing hourly/daily/monthly analytics  
- Used "microwave hours" as relatable energy metric
- Made open-source and available on GitHub

**Shocking Results:**
- One development session = running microwave for 20 hours nonstop
- AI auto-complete requests on every keystroke create massive waste
- Corporate transparency deliberately obscured to hide scale of consumption

**Industry Context:**
Trump administration removed environmental review requirements for AI data centers, indicating the scale of energy infrastructure being built without oversight.

### Michael's AI Development Mastery

**Background:** Built 52 startups in 52 weeks to find product-market fit, eventually focusing on AudioWave (text-to-audio).

**Key Philosophy:** 
- We deliver more outputs but not more outcomes with AI
- Customers don't care about your team size, they want solutions
- Keep it simple vs. extend leverage (balance between capability and complexity)

**Advanced Workflows:**
- Run 4-5 Claude Code sessions simultaneously
- Use overnight automation with caffeinate (Mac sleep prevention)
- Implement automated testing and screenshot critiques for quality control
- Employ Linear→Claude Code automation via Cyrus tool

**Cognitive Concerns:**
Referenced MIT study showing ChatGPT use degrading critical thinking abilities over time, with permanent effects on essay-writing capabilities.

**Technical Stack:**
- Claude Code for main agent work ($200/month, time-limited)
- Cursor for Q&A and specific questions
- Repo Prompt for business context integration
- Voice mode for walking strategy discussions

## Community Development Highlights

### Indigenous Leadership Integration
Jonathan Williams (Squamish Nation) demonstrated practical AI usage for cultural advisory work, using AI to parse 250-300 page development documents to identify sections needing indigenous consultation.

**Cultural Context:**
- Only ~60 people speak Squamish at toddler level
- Only ~7 fluent speakers remaining  
- AI allowing cultural advisors to focus on actual advisory work rather than document parsing
- Williams using AI for political campaign (running for Squamish Nation council)

### Subgroup Ecosystem Expansion

**Mind AI & Consciousness Group:**
- Rigorous academic approach with required reading
- Discussed Apple's "Illusion of Thinking" paper
- Attendance at Science of Consciousness Conference in Barcelona
- Deep philosophical discussions on consciousness, agency, and AI capabilities

**Surrey AI Community:**
- Monthly events with "circle talks" allowing everyone to participate
- 20-30 regular attendees in more intimate setting
- Growing rapidly, sometimes doubling attendance month-over-month
- 33% discount available with "Vancouver AI" code

**AI Film Club:**
- Kevin launching creative community for filmmaking applications
- Monthly meetups planned starting August
- Focus on human community in rapidly changing technical landscape
- UBC venue with secret green screen studio access

### Corporate Integration Success
[[Noah Brunn]] (Arturs Technology Leadership) implementing comprehensive AI change management across architectural firm, creating "Responsible AI Handbook" encouraging safe experimentation while avoiding "shadow AI" usage.

## Meditation Experience Analysis

[[Peter Bowles]] guided community through extended meditation focusing on:
- **Individual grounding:** Golden light visualization and body awareness
- **Collective consciousness:** Sensing shared community vibration  
- **Future visioning:** AI serving human flourishing and environmental healing
- **Personal agency:** Community members as bridge-builders and wisdom keepers

**Community Response:** Generally positive but feedback for shorter duration next time, showing openness to integrating wellness practices into technical gatherings.

## Memorable Quotes

**Lionel Ring:** "One day AI will be smarter than us, and when that time comes, I wanted to love us enough to save us." (On AI energy consciousness)

**Michael YaDev:** "Don't outsource your thinking. Write your initial task yourself, think about the initial solution, and then write it down and have the LLM help you come up with a better solution."

**Gabriel George:** "We need to be connected to one another and the importance of that and not to be siloed... using these tools, these new tools, these modern tools, and using this beautiful community."

**[[Peter Bowles]] (Meditation):** "You are living proof that consciousness and technology can dance together beautifully."
