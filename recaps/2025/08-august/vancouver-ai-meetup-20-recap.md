## Keynote Highlights

### Jos Duncan: "Love and AI Advocacy"

**Background:** Media personality and social justice advocate from Philadelphia, co-leading Google News Initiative AI program with Kris.

**Personal Opening:** Navigating grief and loss through community celebration - lost loved one but chose to attend to celebrate life and human connection.

**Journey with AI:**
- Initially embraced AI for bridging tech/tactile working class divide
- Community felt betrayed by her AI adoption
- Created transparent AI ethics policy to rebuild trust
- Discovered personal vs. business ethics through negotiations training

**Corporate Accountability Message:**
- Billion-dollar AI companies causing environmental harm and IP theft
- Users being asked to be responsible while corporations avoid accountability  
- Need for collective advocacy beyond individual ethics policies
- "One day AI will be smarter than us, and when that time comes, I wanted to love us enough to save us"

**AI Advocacy Initiative:**
- Education and information about AI capabilities and harms
- Collective demands benefiting humanity
- Calling out harmful actors and demanding corrective action
- Uplifting organizations doing good work (mentioned Lionel Ring's energy calculator)

### Peter Bittner: "Future of Work and AI Upskilling"

**Reality Check:** 
- AI makes us deliver more outputs but not more outcomes or polished products
- We're in the first inning of AI adoption with significant organizational resistance
- Every client asks: "Help our workers feel less scared of AI"

**Core Problem:** 
- Universities not preparing students for AI literacy requirements
- Half of workers struggling to acknowledge their skills are outdated
- Need for continuous learning mindset shift

**AI Literacy Framework:**
- **Hard Skills:** Prompting, automation tools, basic coding knowledge, understanding LLMs
- **Human Skills:** Creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, communication
- **Domain Expertise:** Unique background and experiences that AI cannot replace

**Economic Context:**
- Projections of 7% GDP growth in US/Canada from AI adoption
- We're experiencing introduction of electricity-level transformation
- Job market challenges for graduates without AI literacy

**Solution:** The sweet spot exists at intersection of AI hard skills, human soft skills, and domain expertise.
