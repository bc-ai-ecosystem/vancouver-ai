## Key Highlights

### Groundbreaking Keynote: AI + Indigenous Knowledge + Plant Communication

**Manuel Axelstrain** (two-spirit Coast Salish artist, Vines Art Society co-director) delivered the most philosophically profound keynote in Vancouver AI history, presenting an ambitious vision: **using AI to help humans understand what trees and plants are communicating**.

**The Vision:**
- Create AI systems that can interpret the multiple ways plants communicate (mycelium networks, chemical signals, electrical pulses, etc.)
- Combine indigenous knowledge (singing to plants, dream communication, ceremonial harvest) with modern science
- Use this understanding to help regenerate forests and ecosystems
- Center Coast Salish values of honesty, respect, and interconnectedness

**The Paradox:**
Indigenous knowledge systems ask us to **go back** (remember who we are, where we come from). AI asks us to **go forward** (to places we haven't been). Manny's work exists in the tension between these two directions.

**Key Quote:**
> "If indigenous people know that if you sing to the plants they'll grow better, then we can have a lot of humans in the forest singing together, and that will help regenerate the forest better, which can help all of us."

**Art Exhibition Integration:**
Manny's solo show at Richmond Art Gallery uses AI to visualize medicinal compounds in indigenous plants (Paclitaxel from yew trees, lithium, mycelium networks), creating pictographic-style images that bridge microscopic science with ancestral artistic traditions.

**Collaboration Request:**
- **Needed:** Non-invasive sensors to measure plant signals
- **Needed:** Funding for research and development
- **Needed:** Partnerships across disciplines (botanists, AI engineers, indigenous knowledge keepers)
- **Contact:** manuelaxelstrain.com

**Related Projects Mentioned:**
- AI almanac for indigenous territories in Russia (2017+)
- Terra Zero (Germany): self-managing forest with crypto economy that can "pay for its own maintenance"

---

### Indigenous Language Preservation Through AI

**jonny williams** (Squamish Nation) opened the event with traditional welcome song and prayer, then shared his transformative AI story:

**The Challenge:**
- Only **5 fully fluent Squamish speakers** remain
- **60-70 new generation speakers** at adolescent/child level (from recent cohorts)
- As cultural advisor, Johnny reviews 200-300 page official community plans for cultural content
- Finding relevant sections was nearly impossible without fluent reading ability

**The Solution:**
- Johnny trained AI on Squamish information and cultural knowledge he possesses
- Now drops 10 PDFs into AI on Monday morning
- AI pulls all paragraphs needing cultural consultation
- Johnny transformed from "document parser" to **actual cultural advisor**

**Current Use:**
Creating campaign materials for Squamish Nation Council election (vote: September 28th)

**Key Insight:**
AI doesn't replace indigenous expertise—it **amplifies** it, allowing knowledge keepers to focus on the work only they can do.

**Language Context:**
- **Kamala** (Squamish word): "Place of lots of maples" (what we now call Greater Vancouver)
- Squamish naming philosophy: describe what's happening in a place, don't name after people

**Revolutionary Experience:**
Mimeograph → zines → chapbooks → dial-up ISPs → notable campaigns in Coast Salish territories

---

## Difficult Conversations: Indigenous Data Sovereignty + AI Ethics

### The Core Tension

**Kris Krüg Lag Carpenter** raised critical indigenous AI ethics question to Manny:

> "One of the hard things as indigenous folks: there's protocol, rules, regulations around how we use and deploy our knowledge (story, song, dance, painting). What are the ethics/protocols you're following when putting work into AI where there's potential for loss of control?"

**Manny's Response:**

**The Dilemma:**
- Indigenous intelligence has been appropriated and misused throughout history
- If knowledge isn't delivered properly → appropriation, misunderstanding, confusion
- **But:** If indigenous people are left out of AI conversations → potentially more harm

**The Process:**
- Consults with elder Shane Point
- Shane's guidance: "We need everyone. Young people need to find a way to make this work"
- Created "Threshold" exhibition (2023) exploring this exact tension

**The Technical Solution:**
- Programmed AI to follow UNDRIP (UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples)
- Programmed AI to follow principles of consent
- Result: AI will say "I cannot tell you that" when appropriate

**Quote:**
> "It's quite an easy adjustment—just ask it to follow UNDRIP and follow consent. And it will just point blank tell you, 'I can't tell you that.'"

---

### The Intention vs. Communication Problem

**Audience Question:**
"There is a difference between communication and intention. How do you measure intention? Nature is straightforward, but we're not."

**Manny's Profound Response:**

**Traditional Protocol:**
When Coast Salish people welcome visitors, traditionally you approach and **state your intentions**. Hosts then decide: "Okay, sounds good. You're welcome."

**Historical Betrayal:**
When settler people came, they **stated intentions** that weren't their **true intentions**. This is an issue Coast Salish and Interior Salish people have dealt with for 150+ years: **How do we trust your intentions?**

**AI Challenge:**
Cannot know if what the tree/plant AI is saying is real. Trees live 2,000 years—we might only capture micro-signals, not full messages.

**Approach:**
Think of plant AI communication as **collection of data samples** we can try to read, rather than direct translation.

**Cultural Solution:**
> "Coast Salish people really value and honor honesty and respect. Intuitively, this is why we have to be the ones that do this, because we value that more than I think a greater society does. We believed people's intentions, and that's why we have all these people from other places here. That's why we have all this beautiful city here, because we just trusted, we took your word for it, and we still are."

### The Commons + Watershed Investment

**Audience Contribution:**
Helped BC government determine **dollar value of the commons** (ephemeral resources with value but no clear responsibility).

**Innovation:** Logic tree expressing value/desire of relationships between humans and natural systems
**Current Use:** Local government investing in watershed assets

## Philosophical Reflections

### What AI Can Look Like

**Kris Krüg's Framing:**
> "AI doesn't have to look like Silicon Valley. It doesn't have to look like Mark Zuckerberg. It does not have to look like Elon Musk. It can look like jonny williams. It can look like Uncle Weed. It can look like Carly."

**Demonstration Through Diversity:**
- Indigenous cultural advisors preserving endangered languages
- Two-spirit artists decoding plant communication
- Electrician entrepreneurs building elder care businesses
- Real estate agents finding value properties
- Japanese archivists amplifying 25 years of documentation
- Brazilian circus performers building community infrastructure

### Community as Operating System

**Gabriel Zaro's Thesis:**
Community is humanity's operating system, with evolutionary patches:
- **Patch Zero:** Survival (favela childhood: chaos → organization → trust)
- **Security Patch:** Trust (circus: friends holding your rope 40 feet up)
- **Intelligence Patch:** Reactive → Proactive (gaming communities → BC + AI)

### The Creation Story Connection

**Coast Salish Teaching (via Manny):**
All beings descended from the sky. **Xals the Transformer** turned some humans into rocks, animals, and plants to teach lessons about interconnection.

**Scientific Parallel:**
All life on Earth came from single cell that first started dividing.

**Convergence:**
Indigenous knowledge and Western science arriving at same truth through different paths: **everything is connected**.

## Reflection: Why This Meetup Mattered

Vancouver AI Meetup #21 will be remembered as the event that **centered indigenous wisdom** in AI discourse, not as token inclusion but as **essential guidance** for technology development.

Manuel Axelstrain's keynote posed a question that cuts to the heart of what AI could become: Can we use pattern recognition and massive datasets to help humans reconnect with the natural world? Can technology amplify rather than replace ancient knowledge systems?

The contrast between jonny williams (using AI to preserve Squamish language and culture) and Manuel's vision (using AI to decode plant communication) shows indigenous communities aren't just **using** AI—they're **reimagining what it's for**.

The difficult conversations about intention, consent, and data sovereignty weren't sidebar discussions. They were the main event, grappling with questions every AI developer should be asking: Whose knowledge? Whose consent? Whose benefit?

Meanwhile, the community infrastructure (Discord, matchmaking, hackathons) continued to mature, creating economic opportunity and peer learning at scale. The diversity of applications—from real estate to trades to archiving to consciousness research—demonstrated AI as general-purpose amplifier of human capability.

**Most Importantly:** The meetup modeled what AI development could look like when it's grounded in relationship, ceremony, humility, and recognition that humans have always been part of—not separate from—the natural and spiritual world.

As Manny said: We all descended from the sky. Some became rocks, some became animals, some became plants, some stayed human. **We're all connected.** Maybe AI can help us remember that.
