# Contributing to the Vancouver AI Meetups Archive

Thank you for your interest in this archive.

## What This Repository Is

This is a **read-only archive** of Vancouver AI Community meetup documentation. It contains:
- Verbatim transcripts of monthly meetups
- Analytical recaps with key themes and takeaways
- Machine-readable indexes for programmatic access

The content is exported from the canonical BC + AI Ecosystem knowledge base and published here as a public data source for the community.

## What This Repository Is NOT

- A wiki (content is not directly editable here)
- A discussion forum (use [Vancouver AI Community](https://vancouver.bcai.net) for that)
- The source of truth (that lives in the private knowledge base)

## How to Use This Data

You are encouraged to use this archive for:

- **Research**: NLP analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis
- **RAG applications**: Build semantic search or Q&A systems over meetup history
- **Visualization**: Create network graphs, timelines, or dashboards
- **Content creation**: Quote speakers (with attribution), write summaries, create derivative works
- **Community tools**: Build bots, notifications, or integrations

See the [README](README.md) for specific project ideas and the data structure.

## Cultural Protocols

This archive contains documentation of indigenous ceremonial openings and cultural content. When working with this material:

1. **Respect**: Treat indigenous ceremony content with cultural sensitivity
2. **Attribution**: Always credit indigenous speakers by name and nation
3. **Context**: Don't extract ceremonial content out of its original context
4. **Consultation**: For substantial use of indigenous content, consider reaching out to the community first

These are community norms, not legal requirements.
