# Vancouver AI Community Meetup #14 - Verbatim Transcript
**Date:** February 2024  
**Location:** McMillan Space Centre (Planetarium), Vancouver  

---

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  and sorry I could not travel both,  and be one traveler.  Are you familiar with the teletransportation paradox?  You, this hypothetical you,  enter a machine somewhere on earth.  The machine scans you, creating a perfect molecular blueprint.  It then atomizes you.  Another machine, on Mars or Venus or Kalamazoo, recreates you, using that molecular blueprint and a local supply of molecular material. 

All the thoughts and memories and experiences of you  are possessed by U on Venus or Mars or Kalamazoo,  including getting into the machine somewhere on Earth.  Is U  you?  Now let's say the machine malfunctions.  And this is how the professor from whom I first heard this thought experiment, and about whom the version of this piece from which most of this introduction has been self plagiarized.

Was  this is how he presented it to us. This was the version most interesting to him in other versions. What I am about to introduce was in fact an upgrade.  Certainly what is an upgrade to some is a defect to others.  The machine malfunctions and neglects to destroy you.  The second machine on Mars or Venus or Kalamazoo creates you prime at the moment of awakening, all the same thoughts and memories.

And experiences are possessed by both you and you prime,  which you. And  let's say that if there are two, one right here and one in Kalamazoo, that simply won't do. One's time is through,  but whose?  Will you volunteer for death by lethal injection or hanging or firing squad,  given that the machine was meant to disintegrate you? 

Or should you prime volunteer? for the crime of being new.  It was at about this point in the discussion that a fellow student cried out in frustration. We've been talking about this for half an hour and haven't come up with any conclusions. Why bother?  A great point, to be sure.  But nonetheless, I would like us to, instead, imagine that the destination platform is three feet to your left. 

That you close your eyes. And feel the warmth of that atomizer as you take a deep breath.  Then open your eyes to find yourself three feet to the left.  To find yourself  exactly where you started. To find yourself three feet to the right.  And you blink as I blink.  And the room is twice as full. Twice the knowing.

Twice the weight. Twice the certainty that I am. Except I am also over there. 

Except, I am  also looking at me.  Standing at a slight angle, my breath in sync, yet already different. Already not me. Already somebody I do not know. Someone whose eyes I cannot see through. Someone who is looking left instead of right. Someone who is looking right instead of left.  And I wait, as I wait. Or I suppose we  For the moment, I flinch,  but there is no flinch.

No hostile motion, no horror film hesitation, just the slow clicking of an invisible clock I didn't know I was counting on.  I turn,  my body's facing, my head's cocked.  In, 

in bewilderment,  in curiosity,  I smile at the absurdity, and so do I think,  not quite, a beat too slow, or too fast, maybe just a trick of the eyes,  my mouth opens to speak, and so does mine,  I hear myself answer first, not at the same time, not at the same time, not at the same time!  My body's waiting for a cue that was once automatic.

Somewhere the timing has slipped. Somewhere an eye has fallen behind, fallen out of sync with myself. That twitch of my finger before my own. The breath misting forward just ahead of mine, as if the error has a preference. 

That creeping rot of error.  Of redundancy.  I inhale,  and so do I.  Too soon, too late, a staggered echo, a misfire, a step forward, a step back, waiting for myself to follow.  I move deliberately,  and so do I,  or do I follow?  I laugh and hear myself falter mid breath, a misaligned chuckle, like a joke told in the same room twice met with silence the second time,  a file duplicated instead of overwritten.

Not deleted, no, but one, faded, never to be touched again,  a flicker,  a knowing look.  A decision to be made,  I wait, as I wait, poised at the edge of symmetry, for me, or me, to,  I step forward, a half second ahead of myself,  I turn,  I reach for me,  I am already gone.  Thank you. 

Thank you, Brittany. That's Brittany Smiley. You're gonna be hearing more from her later.  What a cool twist you bring to these events with your poetry. She's been doing stuff for the last six months or so. We've got quite the archives of Brittany's explorations around artificial intelligence and virtual reality and the future. 

Welcome everybody. There's a lot of new faces tonight. Thanks for coming to our exploration of what it means to be human in the age of AI. I'm gonna break my chill now and be like, we gotta get this guy out of here. So we're going to go into the community announcement section, which is this little part at the beginning here where I invite a few people up to just say a few things.

Most of you know who you are, but a couple of people I might call on as well. Shane, you want to come talk about what you're launching, what you're up to, bro? Awesome.  Thank you, Kris Krüg.  Great to see everybody here again tonight. I think this has got to be my sixth or at least seventh of these, I think.

This is awesome.  Yeah, I've been here since the beginning and a lot has changed in a year, to say the least. So something that we've been working on my background, I've got a sales performance company. I'm an author speaker and working on a new project with Kris Krüg and his team for, with the AI upgrade on AI for sales leaders and sales professionals, but I want to step back and go what does that really mean and in two minutes or less.

And so what I see the power of what kind of what we're doing now is combining AI with empathy.  For sales results, that's, and life results, business results. And so one of the really cool experiments that we've been working on is we always think like a lot of salespeople or business owners are like, how do I get AI to do stuff?

I don't like to do  right. If I can cut that down and cut three, four hours a day out of my work, I'm successful, but the real genius of it for me is when it's riding beside you and helping you get better. As an iterative tool. So a lot of what we've been working on within sales academy is actually building things like a discovery coach.

So something that sits next to you, evaluates your sales calls, coaches you on how to get better rewrite, and even catches you when you forget to listen or you cut your customer off and helps you improve over time because. The highest form of training,  according to one of my long time martial arts teachers, Fred Shadian, is self reflection. 

And I think that's one of the most powerful parts of AI. Assisting us is that self reflection and that personal iteration and development, along with not doing the stuff we don't like to do. And so this is really what that program's about. We put it together. Kris Krüg, I'm sure we'll share some links later.

But I hope you all enjoy this evening as I run to the next thing. But thanks, Kris Krüg.  Thanks, Shane. I'm  studying some martial arts with Shane. And Shane's studying some martial arts with Loki, who you guys have heard from in the past from Circle Innovation. And both these guys got to race off to Academy Dwello.

They get their brain fixed and then they go get their physical fixed. So thanks a lot for coming, guys. Good work you're doing out there, Loki. Look forward to connecting with you more soon. Thanks. Thanks for sharing that. Shane just graduated from one of these courses that I run, which is like my day job, bread and butter.

There's some other people in here that have taken them and he blew it out of the water so hard that we asked him to come back and actually do a micro version of the course for salespeople. So that's what he was talking about there. I got all these AI trainings coming up soon for journalists and sales peeps and creative peeps.

Hit me up if you want more information about that one.  Okay, community announcements. Catherine Warren, where are you at? Yeah. And then who else did I have? Quanah, I didn't tell you're not even a part of this community. But I welcome you nonetheless and would like for you in a minute to just come up and introduce yourself. 

Thank you so much. Hey everyone, it's great to be here together on the Musqueam, territory. And Kris Krüg, I am so grateful for everything you do to bring us together, to convene with purpose, and do this in the spirit of reconciliation, so thank you.  I am also overjoyed to be in my teenage happy place, the Planetarium, which is home of the Pink Floyd laser show. 

Does that bring back memories? Yes, it does. So I am Catherine Warren. I am founder of Fantrest. And we do innovation for entertainment and for economic development. And on the AI side, I'm involved with a company that I've worked with for about 20 years. They're called Ray. They're a global company based here in Vancouver.

And We are solving a problem, and that problem is that for too long large AI training models have stolen and scraped the content of rights holders. And we are creating an ethical economy where rights holders, specifically if you have a large library of audio or visual material, can for the first time be paid for that content In order for it to train AI systems, you're going somewhere next week? And I'm going, yeah, I'm going next week to New Zealand to consult to the government there on their creative and innovation economy and hopefully to see our friend Peter Lucas Jones, who is here just in December talking about his AI system for indigenous language learning.

Yeah, thank you so much for coming. I've known Catherine for 20 years as well. Thanks so much for sharing what you have to do. This woman's a badass. She's got the ear of many powerful government decision makers when it comes to creativity, innovation, creative technology, and the future.

And she's always got something very interesting up her sleeve. Going to New Zealand, like we said, next week, gonna meet with Peter Lucas Jones, and going to present some of the projects that we're all working on with the rest of the world, which is cool. In fact, Penfather, are you here? 

Will you come next? Because I wanted you to talk to her before she goes on her trip. Penfather works at Emerging Media Lab at UBC. He's a professor. He's a professor of drama. But he also has an interest in technology. He's got a lot of interesting claims to fame. He often comes up here and cuts it up and is a ham.

He's let us in sing alongs, improv, all sorts of interesting things. But he's got a really serious side to him as well that I think he's more comfortable showing the hilarious side, but we work together and we've been working on some interesting stuff and he invited me on behalf of us to participate in a research study that he's publishing soon.

I get to be a co author on with some other people and I wanted him to talk about that specifically for Catherine because she's looking to go tell the story of. What's going on in BC and Canada to the world.  Awesome. Thanks, Kris Krüg. Fabulous introduction. I'm going to try to talk fast because Kris Krüg said one minute, even though he gave others two minutes. 

Okay, that's fair. So I'll talk really fast. I'm a researcher. You can look me up on Google. Just Type in Patrick, and you'll get a bunch of hits.  Usually St. Patrick comes up first, which makes sense for some people. My mother.  So look,  I am fascinated by community and how community is growing, especially in this space.

And so I have been doing a lot of literature reviews on what research is there? Based on this and there's not that much if you know of research that I might not know of please Talk with me after this is complete this part of the evening. I thought Why don't I do a pilot reflection which for BC studies journal on The building of this community of practice which is growing Which changes fluctuates?

Adapts just like the technology. We're all  And I'm doing this study, and we, the next phase of this study is to work with Kris Krüg, and we will most likely send out participant basically participant surveys to see who would be interested in doing that. I would love for you to talk with me if you're interested in this study, and thank you, Kris Krüg. 

Oh yeah, I've got a book. I like writing. And so I have a new book and it's in my phone.  Yeah, Kris Krüg is in the book too. I interviewed him and other professionals. It's called Regenerating Learning. It's right here if you need it. I'm not allowed to give it away. So if you want it, come meet me at the break. 

Yeah, it's only 549 pages. I don't see what the big deal is. It's a fast read if you skim it.  Thank you, Kris Krüg. Thank you everyone. I'll talk with you soon. 

He's always up to interesting stuff. The big hug going on over here. These guys got some collaborations going on. It's possible that EML is making some space available or some podcast and video production coming from this community. So we're all working on that together. Quanah, you're in the you're, I got you.

So you just hang there for one sec. Erwin, would you come up?  Erwin Oostendie, are you still here, brother? Alright, very good. Again, a man I've known for about 20 years. A lot of you guys probably know Erwin. He's been involved with lots of things. He's a downtown Eastside activist. He's an educator.

He's taught me a lot of things in my life. And I'm happy that you're, this is his first time here, I've been inviting him for a while, another member of our community bought him a ticket, so I'm happy that you showed up, happy that you're getting back into this stuff, and you're welcome to share with whatever you're up to, bud. 

Kris Krüg, yeah, we worked a lot of us worked together on a project called W2, and back in the day when all the the social tech was thriving in Vancouver, and I think Kate and Michael are there, and Will and Robin and others. So yeah, I run a company called Vore Urban Labs and so we do social research and use technology.

We do largely decolonizing public policy. That's mostly what we do. So most of our clients are municipal governments.  But we're, SIGGRAPH is coming up in August and so we're producing a 20 minute program at SIGGRAPH.  And it'd be, I think it'd be a fun thing for the community to join in on.

I'm really interested in I mentioned decolonizing public policy. The role of folks that look like me, settlers, who are of European descent, but settlers, all settlers are migrants and our responsibility to walk in a good way and be in good relations, right relations, to to First Nations here.

And technology has a role to play, and so we're building a project that will Create an interactive environment to enact that kind of good protocol work, where visitors come, 4, 000 conference delegates come to Vancouver, and how do we help them land in a good way, and what's that immersive, interactive experience yeah.

So that's one of the things, and Erwin is a first order source of knowledge when it comes to a lot of things, reconciliation, especially from an ally and settler perspective. I encourage you, if you're interested in that kind of stuff, reach out to him. He's always got a strong, challenging voice yeah. 

Appreciate you being here, bud. I think now is probably the right time for me to say to you guys who come here on the regular, know that we often have someone sing and do a welcome. We've had Gabriel George come in recently, but he couldn't make it tonight. We've had jonny williams in the past.

Erwin works with the Tsleil Waututh Nation. I know Reuben George and some other people there and stuff, and so Catherine, thanks for making an acknowledgement and Erwin, thanks for representing as well. That is a, those buildings that are being built right outside of here, are Squamish Nation high rises, right?

And a lot of this land, Erwin would do a better job than me telling you exactly what's going on, but a lot of this has been given back for redevelopment by the Squamish Nation and, it's like very in demand urban real estate worth a lot of money and it's, uh, it's a special case in the whole wide world, and it's something a lot of people are paying attention to.

Okay, Kwana, you want to come up for a sec? The reason I invited Kwana, he made it all the way over from Hornby Island British Columbia. So that's pretty cool. That's three ferries away, if you don't know. Also, he's a part of my origin story he said in front of a group of people earlier that he is the first person to ever tell me about AI, and that might be true.

I don't think it's true. I have a date on a but it might be true. But what is true is he, before I had wrapped my head around it, and we're talking probably August 2022, I think, or September type, what's your date that you got? I have, telling you, chatGBT, December  Very good. Yeah, very good. I started my Discord server on September 25th.

 There you go. Also, he's the first guy I know who built a box. Yeah. He's the first guy I know who got GPUs, built a box on Hornby, and started actually developing, wrapping his head around AI. I know a whole bunch of people that have written books about AI with AI, but he was the very first person I knew in the summer of 2022.

After that, he went on to go study data science online during the pandemic from Hornby Island while maintaining a family and a hacker space and a beautiful rural life that I missed quite a bit, actually.  And and then he's gone on to some pretty awesome shit since then from Hornby. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna just go ahead and let you spill the rest of the beans and introduce yourself. 

Hi I guess I'm on the spot here. Hi everybody yeah quick little thing, let's see. I played with the chatbots very early on. I was I don't know how much time I've got, but I'm gonna go for a minute and a half. Very early on I played in the com boom and bust. I was late on that game.

Shortly thereafter I took a left turn into photography. I was there when the digital analog transition was happening, and I got to be on the forefront of that. When I left photography 

I became a professional photographer with a point and shoot camera, a little Canon Elf, and that's how I made my first 800 in one hour doing photography.  Anyway, that's a different story. Then when I saw how impactful large language models were, I was determined to be on the forefront of that. And so I hunkered down and did everything I possibly could to learn about a I.

The first thing I did is I wrote a book thinking critically in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. I wrote it with ChatGPT and it told me just how impactful it was going to be. And that time, that's when I really started to get deep into it. And one of the things that I thought was really intriguing was how to actually own, have your own compute.

If you don't have your own compute, if you're not able to do the things on your own  With your own data sovereignty. It gets weird. Anyway, that's a little bit about me. Yeah. Will you say what you're up to now? Yeah, so I work with large language models in the chat space for one of the FANG organizations.

Yeah, speaking on behalf of no one, but you might notice the hoodie he's wearing tonight if you want to fill in that, yeah. Kushal, you're not talking. I just wanted to make sure you talked to Quanah here tonight, man. He's like our open source dude. Yeah, he's our open source. He was running the, he's the first guy I ever know to run OpenAI's API, and actually that's how he wrote the book.

It wasn't by typing fucking prompts into a website.  Fair enough, Kush.  All right, where are we going from here? Who else? Not the demoers, but who else? Don't worry, Dean, I got you, bro. I knew you were going to raise your hand, that's why I said not the demoers. Did I ask anyone else to give a community announcement or is there?

Oh, yeah, that's right. Riv and Matthew, please come on up. You guys heard from Matthew last month. Matthew's got a partner in this little spinoff event that he's doing from these meetups and it's Riv. Riv's been coming here and supporting us for a while. And March 6th.  March 11th.  They're doing their first Surrey AI community meetup spun off from this thing.

And I hope that some of you guys that live out in the valley go to it. Just 30 seconds. Introduce yourself, invite everybody out to the thing, and then give Matthew the mic. Hey everyone, my name is Riv.  I came into space in 2022 as well. I learned my, as soon as Chacha BT came around, I got obsessed and went straight into it.

I started learning how to do it, how to use it, what it's like. And I started consulting other business owners, how to use it at all. And that is what all my life is now. And. Inspired by this lovely human over here, Kris Krüg. We wanted to  build the community bigger and send it over into Surrey. So that's where we're going now for March 11th.

And Matthew. 

I, however, Knew nothing about AI, knew nothing about ChatGPT until I met Kris Krüg, had him on my podcast, and then he shared a little bit about what it's all about, got super invested, then I took his his course, absolutely loved it, highly suggest it, and since then it's gotten only better. So yeah, we're hosting the AI event like Riv mentioned, would love to see you guys there.

We're gonna have some some speakers, and it's gonna be a fun night. Sushi. Yeah, it's called the Legion number eight building in South Surrey.  Yeah, thank you, Kris Krüg. No, totally legit, bro. I'm so excited for you guys. It's South by Southwest next week, so I can't be there. Or during the 11th, I can't be there or whatever.

But I think Kevin's gonna be there. I think Victor's gonna be there. Michelle Diamond's gonna be there. Hit these guys up. They could use your support getting out of the gate. They're like, yo, it's pretty far to drive during rush hour to come to these Vancouver meetups, bro. Can we can we do a little spinoff?

So I thought it was pretty exciting. It's like a sign of the good vibes in this room that people are trying to start up other things connected to this out there in the world. So respect guys. Yeah, good job. Okay, anyone else on the community announcement section that's really you're gonna forget me if you pass me by?

All right, now let's get the demoers up here. Dean, Sev, Ed Kennedy.  Is there anyone else? No, I think that's it. These are the guys that were out showing off their projects or ideas. Come on up, guys. No, come on up. You can go last if you want. Dean's a mastermind. Come here. Look at this handsome fucker. 

I'm just excited because Patrick said he has a book, and then the first question I had in mind, is there an AI  for it? 

His whole song that he sang with us, it was there's an AI for that. Exactly. Yeah. You should check it out. We got it on the website. Okay. So I just,  sorry, brother. Sean Wally. Yeah. You guys got a minute, talk about what you're showing out there and what you want to connect with people about. Okay.

Okay. Thank you, Kris Krüg. So first.  Yeah. All right.  Hey folks, I'm Sev. I've been in technology for a long time, 25 years, over 25 years. Last few years, I've been working mostly with Americans. And as I was laying in my tub, recovering from that experience, No offense to Americans, but, did you say laying in your tub?

Laying in the bathtub for a few months. And using ChatGPT to heal my emotional pain. I decided to build an emotional model. And scale it to more people. And that's how Wiserbotics came about. And this is what I'm working on. It's solving the problem of scarcity of empathy in the world. Can 

you say that one more time?  Solving the problem of scarcity of empathy in the world.  I love Zev. Seve is a controversial character in our community. He's got some very strong ideas about the future. In the best way, guys, in the best way. He's a lightning rod of ideas and energy. I don't always agree with you, but I love the way you put your perspectives out there, man.

And I know you've found yourself going intellectually head to head with people in this room. And I appreciate that. I appreciate Simon. wherever you are, that you guys have taken your thing, worked it out, figured it out, what made this a real philosophical debate and stuff. These guys have an interesting one, two punch.

Maybe we'll give him some standup comedy time later or whatever. But he's also doing, he also started an AI band in the last couple of weeks that you're getting better YouTube traction than I am in only two weeks of running your YouTube channel. But he's making very interesting things related to human.

Emotional intelligence, empathy, and our future interaction with the bot. So I appreciate you always showing up, man, and putting your perspective out there. It must not always be easy.  All right. My name is Cian Wally. I'm a fractional CTO for startups in Fortune 500 companies, and I'm also a Zen Buddhist priest.

And that  second part is more the result of what you see out there, although obviously I'm using my tech skills as well. The app that I'm demoing is called Digital Buddha. It's at thoughtcoder. com, all of you can log in, it's free to use. And it is your AI spiritual mentor. It has been trained on Buddhism, Kabbalah, and Hermetics.

And it has also been trained not to try to solve your problem as quickly as possible.  And the men in the audience will understand how valuable a skill that is. So yeah so digital Buddha is, it came out of my coaching practice, which is my Zen background, and it is designed more for in between sessions.

Because people were always texting me and wanting immediate answers. And I'm just a mirror. And I'm like AI is a mirror too, but it's read every book on Buddhism, every single one. That's awesome. Isn't that awesome? You can have this like vast knowledge crammed into  Contextualize to a very long winding conversation you have with AI over a half hour about your life, your family your childhood, your job, everything.

And it just pieces it all together and empathizes with you. And then says, Oh yeah, the ancient traditions say, maybe try this practice and that'll probably help you. Yeah. I know there's some threads of your work in CeCe's talk that we're going to give later. I'll let her allude to that, but I just wanted to take a second, interject anyone who's hung out with me or talk to me know that I, one of the most valuable uses of AI I found is in introspection, self reflection, recording my voice into my phone, turning it into a transcript, writing a bunch of.

guides, essentially perspectives that analyze my dream journal or my fears, my anxieties or whatever. And this is the type of shit this guy's hip to. He's and he's built a whole app around it. And there's other people in this room I know who are interested. Who's the person who told me their wife works for Fraser Valley Health Authority and is trying to figure out some mental health stuff.

Darren over there should talk to Sean, talk to Dean Shev. I'm interested in that stuff. I know there's some other people in the room that are up to the very, very similar things. And If you haven't done it Brittany just hit the token limit for her favorite chat with one of her guides that she's built.

And she's trying to figure out how to take the next step or where maybe we could bring her into your world or something. Brittany's a special guide or whatever. But if you haven't done self reflection. Talking to AI, talking it out into your phone, transcribing it and analyzing it from a whole variety of different perspectives.

I think you're missing out. Anyway, Ed Kennedy.  Hey everyone. So I'm an artist. And now I'm a founder as well. And I brought the piece that's out in the hallway there. Where there's the frame with those images. I made this in the beginning of 23 and it's basically using open source technology, a program called Automatic 11.

11. And I really wanted to investigate this idea of a quote from a sculptor. where they said they could just look at a stone if they're a good sculptor and see the sculpture immediately underneath the stone. So what I did to process these images is I took a whole bunch of source material from books that I had scanned the images.

I took old 50s and 60s science fiction illustrations and a whole bunch of other images that I'd already created. And then I used something called control nets to process them in all these different ways and just really make like a fertile ground for the AI to try to decipher what I'm prompting out of this mess of all these images and processes and different generative models.

So that's what you see there. There's probably a thousand on there. I probably have like maybe five or seven thousand at home from those. I would do them in batches of four to six hundred at a time. The benefits of having your own GPU, right? You can just hit go and wake up in the morning and you've got a bunch of fresh art ready to go.

So yeah, take a look you just swipe your hand in between those two metal poles to the left to right, and it will advance them. We'll see if we can get to the end of it by the end, I don't know. And yeah, I'm working on an app right now that uses AI it's called Extendly, E X T N D L Y. And I'll be launching in beta next, next month.

But the idea is to center human relationships. I find with social media, we've lost a lot of agency on who we talk to, when we talk to them. So it's an idea about staying in contact with people and bringing authentic, agentic conversations with AI that doesn't replace us. It just enhances what we want to do. 

Yeah. Thanks, Kris Krüg. End scene.  Give us 30 seconds on control nets.  Yeah, so control nets are probably one of the most amazing things about stable diffusion models. Flux also tried to do it, but they didn't quite have the success. There's something really malleable and clay like about the stable diffusion models, in particular SDXL and 1.

5. I'll take it back. Control vectors.  Oh, control vectors. I don't want them to know about control nets. Oh okay. Okay, here we go again.  Hold on, re prompt me. Okay.  All right. Give us 30 seconds on control vectors.  Yeah, so control vectors are similar about this idea of control nets, but they're for language models.

A control vector is a really tiny trained information that's like a mood, almost. And you can use it to influence the language model. So you can make like happy and sad and then when you prompt you could see hey, all I want to learn about electron tunneling and then you could just say happy 0.

7 and it'll be like Yeah, electron tunneling is pretty cool, it's not a neat technology, or you can make it sad and be like, I don't even want to talk about electron tunneling. This is just depressing me, right? So you really get a lot of control over it. It will pick out a place in the brain.

Think about it like the language model is this vast network, and it's lighting up certain parts of that when you prompt it. A control vector is just like pointing to one part of it, and saying, hey, only Kind of talk from this area in particular. A lot of us are used to writing system prompts that teach the AIs how to write in our voice and shit like that.

Talk about how the approach we're doing right now is brute force compared to what you're able to do with these control vectors.  It's funny, and I would actually say the control vectors are more brute force than the prompting. Cause they're really saying no, only talk from this area. They were originally created for safety.

Because you can't prompt around them if you want to get a credit card number out of a language model Which is a popular like red team kind of activity  They'll just like revert to that area where it's safe and where they don't give out credit card numbers So it's a really powerful technology as an example of this if you had a customer service bot and it was like doing everything the customer said and really happy about it Like sure, we'll destroy your car you might want to Tone it down a little bit and you'd say, Hey, actually, I only want you being like 60 percent customer service happy, like maybe just chill out a little bit.

And that's some like level of control that you can get out of these control vectors that if you try to prompt that. You're like, I want you to be nice, but not too nice, but just enough so the customer's happy and the language model just gets confused. It's a new tech it's only available in like open source, Anthropic's kind of messing around with it a little bit.

But if, yeah, if you want to look at the Golden Gate experiment, there's lots of funny things there, or just search for, I gave a language model acid. And that'll do it. Thanks Ed.  Ed just quit his fat cat corporate job to focus on his startup.

 He's looking for funders and for a co founder potentially. You should talk to him. He's up to some really interesting shit.  All right, guys, let's give Dean the stage. I think it means something to him. Here you go, bud.  Thank you so much, Kris Krüg.  Big shout out to everyone here who really supported myself, my colleagues, and Kris Krüg over the past year.

I came into the community last summer and I had a very simple question. I wanted to learn about AI. And I wanted to learn about AI in healthcare. What's happened from this question on is a journey. And the journey been quite exciting. In fact, is we have Polina there in the back. She has organized several AI dilemmas.

Conversations where we from community came together to debate about the ethics of AI, of ethics of AI in different areas, including the healthcare. Out of that, As a journey, what came out is opportunities. What this community really gives,  under the leadership of Kris Krüg and everyone here, is opportunities for us to connect and build something new together.

As it came out, I became a small founder of the project that has to do with AI in healthcare.  Currently, we have partnered with Northern Eastern University. We have four grad students and a professor working with us on developing an AI model that is developing using Ethics  correctly to help physician learn your clinical data and advise physician on the best way to treat you and create your journey.

So my partners here are from healthcare cherry. Why don't you show a hand over here? So he, she's a real clinician and she's on our board and she's helping us out to figure out if we're building something that's useful. Then we have Hans over there. He has over 10 years in data analytics. So he's helping us to bring the data together.

To build this new and exciting model. So we are only at the beginning of a journey. I hope that we're going to be here more often. Obviously, I'll be here every time. To keep you updated and post it. Once the cap capstone project with North and Eastern University is finished. We are going to go live and we're going to give it to the community.

Thank you.  Thanks. Thanks, Dean. One of the fun things about hosting this type of thing is that I get to invite the people that school me, like Judy, who's one of our keynote speakers tonight. And then I get to let them school people like Dean. So Dean, when Judy's up talking now, you better pay close attention.

I think she might be coming for you, you know,  where are we at, Kevin? All right. Okay. In the last couple months, we've brought on some financial sponsors. Is there anyone from SEGEV here tonight? I think I've seen one of the lawyers.  Is that Marius? Hey, what's up, man? Come say hi real quick.  Dimitri, come say what's up real quick. 

These guys have been putting their money where their mouth is behind backing this community.  You ain't here to give an ad, but what you been up to since I seen you last? Not much interesting, just going out at events. I like IP, it's my third or fourth one, I think. And it's always growing every single time.

There's always people talking about cool stuff. Yeah, happy to support and happy to be involved. Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you. This is Matthew Schwartzman father, by the way.  Thank you, Kris Krüg. I wanted to share one experience I've had last week.  I've made a pretty cool video using AI with myself and NotebookLM  and I've sent it out to three and a half thousand Realtors.

And I said, if anybody wants to do something similar,  let me know and I'll explain to you how it's done free of charge.  The problem was not a single Realtor contacted me and said, I'd like to use it. So I'm sharing this because if anybody has an idea how to get people. to do things even free of charge.

I'll be willing to listen because I want to  improve the real estate community. I want to make it visually more interesting and we are surrounded by a ton of tools that I think are incredible and it's just a matter of knowing how to use it.  Thanks, Dimitri.  Dimitri represents to me one of those guys that's always getting his fingers in the most interesting tools and then applying them to his industry.

He's got a really funny real estate Instagram channel that's hilarious where he's like cutting up and essentially being a stand up comedian as a way to get farm engagement. And now he's learned about AI and trying to figure out and I know that that's what a lot of you here are doing is trying to be on the forefront of this for your industry, take back the lessons from the frontier and take them back, integrate them in your organizations.

And so thanks for supporting this man. And thanks for bringing him out. He's the guy that lined up the old infamous Matthew Schwartzman podcast interview that brought us into connection and friendship. So I'm really grateful for that. All right.  We're almost through the introductions.  What's up next, brother. 

All right. Some of you guys may know Anthony. He runs a really cool AI mastery series here in town. He brings pretty much the most badass infosec security analyst type speakers who are dealing with AI into town. I, him and I have been doing, how many people have messed with the deep seek models or the deep research models or the kind of reasoning models and stuff like that?

They've been dropping them like every week now on us, right? So Anthony and I have been running like deep research battles in the background trying to analyze the Environment around the Vancouver and British Columbia AI ecosystem. So I invited Anthony to come tonight He forgot he was speaking at UBC.

He runs he teaches a class there. So he gave us a quick three minute video That's gonna talk a little bit about this battle. We've been having back and forth 

Sorry I can't make it today. I have a teaching commitment. I couldn't move unfortunately. But I'll catch you guys at the next one. So I'm here with a little quick update on the AI ecosystem here in Vancouver. I'm going to do some strengths, some weaknesses, and then some recommendations. Some pros and cons essentially.

Let's start with some strengths. We've got over 7, 000 AI professionals. That's third behind Seattle and Silicon Valley based on cap based on the amount of density essentially. We are quite packed in terms of the amount of professionals we have. We have a strong academic foundation, so SFU SFU and UBC are very strong academic institutions in Canada and UBC has over 100 faculty that works across AI, across works in AI across their 27 different departments.

We also have lots of chairs at global AI conferences, as we have NeurIPS that just happened, one of the bigger ones that happens every year in Vancouver. And we also have a strong global appeal being in the Pacific time zone. So many large organizations like Amazon and Microsoft love collaboratively across the world.

We also have an established tech ecosystem. With over 115, 000 tech workers across various fields as of a couple years ago.  A couple challenges we have is we have to have more, we actually don't have enough workers with the right skills. So we need more education within Vancouver. We're, we also have a very high cost of living.

So there's a high brain drain. So a lot of our best are moving out to the U. S. And a lot of our best can't afford to start start up. Because they have a large monthly monthly rent and payments. We're also, we also have a good amount of middle capital, but we're missing at the beginning, so pre seed and late stage.

So pre seed as in pre revenue companies and late stage as in companies that are looking for investments of a hundred million plus per investor.  We, and the biggest con here is we have no flagship AI institutes. So Montreal, Toronto, Alberta, they all have AI institutes, while we are actually missing one.

Even though we have such a high AI talent. So a couple of recommendations is develop a made in AI VC strategy. So try to buy AI VC first when you can. Boost R& D investment and incentive, especially at the early stage, because it's a lot cheaper. We also have promotion, promote collaboration and networking.

So we have lots of AI organizations right now working across BC. We should bring them all together and try to build out an AI institute, so rather than everyone working in their pockets, everybody is working together. For example, actually Microsoft just paid 500 people. million dollars to the Montreal AI Institute, so everyone comes together and there's a larger piece of the pie for everyone, or a larger pie.

And then the last thing is Vancouver has the ability to be a leader in responsible AI, so one of the other suggestions is to actually set up an AI advisory council with the provincial government to give them feedback on AI developments here in BC.  Alright, thanks everyone, have a good time, and I'll see you guys all next month. 

Thanks for the thanks for the setup there, Anthony. So a lot of you guys that are in a relationship with me, that have been working with me, know that I am trying to advocate for a BC AI Center with the government. I've got a 30 million proposal in the hands of several different government organizations that are taking a look at it.

Loki Yorgason from Circle Innovation is working on this too, and there's a whole bunch of people here that are trying to. Come together. We've got the ear of some of the corporations around that are backing us, some of the important power players inside the government. And if that's something you're interested in being a part of or learning more about, you can hit up me, you can hit up Anthony.

AI NBC is involved and I don't know where it's going to go, but we're going after the big chunks. We're going to try to get a.  At least creative industries, but probably also healthcare and biosciences, life sciences, incubator and accelerator funded by the government from some of that Justin Trudeau, 2.

4 trillion AI dollars, whatever. So anyway, that's what's going on there, right? Is yes, sir. Why don't you team up with Loki instead?  I think one of the problems we have here is that there are a lot of separate efforts that are.  same bro. Me and Loki are lockstep.  Yeah you got it actually. That's why he's here.

That's why he comes and then goes off to his class. We have dinner before this. We share our plans. We're right there for sure. And, there's other people that we're connected with too. Like I said, AI NBC, the different universities, Simon Fraser, emerging media lab, Northeastern, who Dean talked about here.

We're trying to build a consortium, bro. And it's the only way to do it. The government only wants to get one proposal from all things represent, that represents all the interests of kind of these BC folks. And you've probably heard Fergus Mota Lindley up here talking recently. He works at the WASC Center for Dialogue.

He convened a dialogue on technology project where Katherine Warren and I were and probably some other people in this room.  We're doing our best. We're doing our best. I don't understand how to navigate the system, so I'm like the new guy to this, but Loki provides some stability and some senior mentorship, and there's these other organizations that are involved too, so we are doing our best, and open door.

If you have more input, please, get on board, that's why I talk about this shit up here, is to try to get other folks interested.  Thank you.  Yeah. 

Absolutely. That's what it's all about, dude. It's about trying to take the money from the government and put it in the hands of the people. It's definitely Robin Hood strategy, bro. Yeah.  That's what it's all about. Okay.  All right. Cece. CC's an amazing, inspiring person who I've gotten to know through Ed Kennedy's AI salons that he hosts at his house.

If you happen to strike up a conversation with Ed tonight and connect, I'm sure you'll get invited. I'm so excited about all the ideas you've been sharing with me and for you to be able to come tonight and take the stage and share with the rest of us.  Thank you, Kris Krüg. I'm very impressed how Kris Krüg just prompt up everybody was such a highlight as if we can't not let him down.

So I have to really perform right? And otherwise I was really skewed up. So hi, everyone. What a great pleasure. I really find this community have so many talented people.  So a little bit about myself. So I'm running a consulting practice called Exponential Studio. And my whole passion is really about building conscious exponential organizations.

And why is that? So I spent about 16 years in corporate. And some experience I really enjoyed and some I really didn't. And a majority of that career was Fortune 500, like IBM, Novantis, Siemens, and some brands you probably well know, and some international or multinational brand in Canada, which I helped scaled.

And throughout my career, I find a lot of organizations are built, instead of unleashing human potential, more about suppressing human potential.  So I heard some laughs, I think you can correlate.  So we are really standing at extraordinary times, and there are two mega trends, and I'm sure all of you could relate.

So the first one is the rising of exponential technology, and everybody here today is speaking of artificial intelligence. Obviously, it's the leading force, but it's not just AI. There's also  nanotech. There's a quantum computing. There's advanced sensors. All of this technology standing alone itself is powerful enough, but it's really the emergence of all of them coming together.

And we have Ever entire human history and in the emergence of experience of this technology and what a profound transformation opportunity is empowering individuals and society and the second part I want to talk about is consciousness awakening. For global earth. What does that mean? Because this words is buzzwords on the internet to everybody talk about consciousness.

So during covid and we all experienced the lockdown. So I'll have to confined in our apartment, right? Or some people have fancy houses. You have a backyard. But I'll have to ask the question. We're like, really? Really? Is this it? Is this my life? I get just to, work from home. I don't even know what I'm going to say to my parents, what I'm going to say to my nephews.

I think a lot of people when we're away from that routine life, we get to really question, why am I here? What am I doing? What I do is really life is all about and I think COVID 19 actually have accelerated and a human beings to asking us the big questions and more and more people wanted to work for meanings more and more people looking for purpose in their life.

So what does that mean is if you look at those two mega trends coming together and there are three areas fundamentally would change and impact everybody in this room. And also. Everybody on this planet. So what three areas? The first one is the future of living. I was born in a small village in the northern part of China.

I don't have no running water. Nor portable toilet and not really a lot of basic life amenities people consider here But what you have is community connection and will help each other and even when I have not enough food running on the table We'll just go to neighbor's place. But right now we're humans were living in apartments Boxes 10 years.

Do we even know our neighbors when loneliness become a new? pandemic. I think the future of living will be rewrite when everybody going online and getting more connected to social media, counseling our phones, the fundamental needs of humans want to be loved, want to be connected, become more suppressing.

So the trend in future of living is more. Connected community living instead of isolated in our apartments. And the second part is future of work. And actually this is the part I'm most passionate about because I spend so much time in working in organizations, skilling organizations. Majority of that work is about leadership.

It's about organization transformation, culture, all of the soft and, some people say fluffy, but quite essential. So the future for work is right now you consider a lot of people's career in the past when you're working inside an organization, you would just keep climbing, growing, right? And one day potentially could require that's our parents generation.

But for our generation, and statistically, now people change their jobs. Almost every two years and last time when I was here and I remember there are a few youngsters sitting in the front row asking What are we gonna do when we graduate? We cannot predict in the next three to five years what it would look like.

What job should I pick that give me absolute security? And it's really interesting asking this question, because we wanted to predict and anticipate and what make us safe. I think the future for work is really depends on future for organization and how we dance with that. And the future for work is no longer linear.

We don't have this trajectory, succession planning. So we can link into our chart to say it. In three years, I'll be a manager. Finally, I can afford a two bedroom apartment in the west side of Vancouver.  Okay, there you go. Must be richer. And then the third is the future of play. When I say future of play, it's interesting because when I think of a future of work and future of living, it's about elevating our game.

But when I think of a future of play, it's actually let's play. Because, when we're kids, we play all the time, don't we?  Thank you. I didn't pay for that person by the way, but I appreciate you. But while we're growing up, we forget how to play, right? And we lost that innocence and that passion for really having fun in life.

But there's a lot of researchers, scientists here, and we know a lot of Greek. Inventions is the coming through joy of creation. So how can we bring play and into our life? Because human means we're not isolated. Our life is around a future of work, future of living and future of play. So that being said, and then coming back to how can we create an organization that is a conscious and exponential, and this is the word that passion is.

Because we know a lot of conscious organizations have a great purpose. They want to change the world. They want to make a profound transformation of human beings. But sometimes they're also nonprofit. They don't necessarily go grand scale to run and reach the impact. You also heard organizations are exponential.

We want to grow and.  at almost no cost. They wanted to grab as much as profit as possible. But what if we could bring them together? What if the organization can be so purpose driven, so heart centered, and also can grow at exponential scale, not just revenue, also impact, also contribution to the community, to the country, to the entire global economy.

And that's what that takes. Looking at a conscious  Standing alone, and this is really a part that we have to, as human beings, when we ask all these big questions, remember, the conscious awakening is, have you asked yourself that, why you do what you do, and why you're passionate, what you're passionate about, and how can you align your deepest desire, your talent, your gift into what you want to do for the world.

And as an organization, when I talk about exponential, there are a few key attributes and key characters. So the first one is compared with the linear organization. We have a lot of them right now, and it's really engineered for predictability, for efficiency, and for command and control, because we want to make sure we know exactly how can we report back to our shareholders.

But our world is changing so fast. Those three year strategic plans and five year succession planning may not be suitable for the next two to three years. We don't even know when AGI is going to hit us.  And so from the command and a control, which is a regional design of the organization is a hierarchy pyramids based to a more fluid, more dynamic, more network based organization. 

And a second part is how can an organization from. revenue driven, profit driven, and we want to harness everything squeezing out of employee to actually to a place, and using AI to amplify human potential. When I say amplify human potential, there's two things to look at this.  A lot of people in organizations, when I do consulting, they say, Oh, what if, our people resist?

What if they're worried AI could replace them? And this is, legit question. A lot of us have worked, or still working inside an organization, and They are part of the job you don't necessarily enjoy. If I'm right, please raise your hand. So I see you do agree, it's like there's something you don't, you're like, you know what, there's 20 to 30 percent of work.

I hate it. I just wish someone could take that away from me. Does that resonate?  Okay, good. Good, I think all of us could resonate with this. So That's what AI coming in. So the AI coming in to taking that 20 30 percent of the job away from you. And from in the past, you have a 100%, 30  20 percent on the mending task.

Now when AI took that away, you have an elevated capacity. What else do you want to do with that? So and the third, the last part for the organization is really about how can we avoid isolation? When an organization grows, a lot of companies Anticipate adding more headcount, adding more bodies, and adding more leadership layers, adding more benefits, more perks, more vacations.

So traditionally organization wanted to grow, there's actually a statistic to say if you want to reach 30 annual revenue, and you probably need 250 people, but now more and more I've seen that organization can still lean. I joke, what if we can build a billion dollar business, just under 10 people. 

And I have been working on building my startup two years ago, and I have about 12 volunteers bootstrapping. And back then I want to build a database. I want to build UI, I want to build a website. I want to build a community. We tried for three months at asking for a grant for 300K, 300K.  And just a few months ago, I've discovered that actually.

I can use Cursor and Resell and I'm working with my co founder Sian for almost nothing.  So what does that mean in the future when we're building an organization that doesn't necessarily need to add headcount? What if humans are no longer in a capacity unit? What if we are optimized to amplify our potential?

We're more empowered to do whatever we want to do. So in the end, let me maybe touch on this note. One thing I see is my organization at this stage trying to scale. There's so many AI tools out there, I couldn't even keep up with it. And I don't know if anybody can stay on top of the AI trends and news.

You always know what's the best to use, what's the best deploying organization. But one thing I do know this is. We can't scale a transformed organization in isolation. There's one gentleman ask Kris Krüg a question just now. It's about how can we do things together, right? How can we bring different shareholders, stakeholders together?

So what I find is when organizations are trying to scale, they're often reaching out to different consultants. Operation, ask an operation consultant, AI get an AI consultant. And there's HR. Oh, I get consultant too. And then you have a 10 department, you have a 10 different consultant. They all talk different things and you created a more silo.

And it's time really for us to come in together. For example, this community, we have a different talent, different focuses and different offerings. How can we come in together to fundamentally change the landscape of business? How can we come in together to. Build an organization that is so conscious, so purpose driven, that it can make a profound difference for the world, that is exponential, it's making impact, that we do not need to creating things in isolation.

That's not what we built for. Humans, fundamentally, we wanted to connect. Everybody here tonight, we wanted to connect. And we want to talk to each other, we want to hug each other, we want a physical touch, right? In a good way.  And fundamentally, we wanted to make a difference. Each of us here, we all have a here cause.

I remember I was watching that movie, Gorilla. I don't know if everybody saw that Japanese, Godzilla, I'm sorry. Godzilla. The Japanese government hired a group of volunteers to kill the monster. And then, and the government's, oh, so sad. Those people's gonna die. That's too bad. And the general said, no.

They will die with honor. Because now they will die with meaning. So let's not do that. Let's actually live, but with meaning. And we can come in together. 

I promised Kris Krüg that I would just end it in eight minutes. Hopefully it didn't go over. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay.  Thank you, Cece. Thank you. This is a mix of presentation and public speaking coaching. So this is the light here. Yeah.  This is the dark.  Everything was perfect. Next time stand in the light.

Alright,  How cool is it? Management consultant of the highest order international come here and is trying to understand how AI is impacting our organizations and our lives and our futures. I love talking to you about this stuff. Is there any questions? Someone got a burning question they want to hit CeCe with before we move on. 

A minute here. Yeah, Daria. Now I'm saying the line, okay? I'm not going to say it. Hello, everybody. Aloha. Wonderful to be here. What an incredible community. So how are you planning to, I love, first of all, I love seeing women up in this community. I love that I'm diving into AI as well, and you're so passionate  about this.

How are you planning on  merging the world of A. I. and conscious leadership in organizations. I'd love to talk to you after as well, but how are we going to do that together? Thank you. Wow that's a very big question. I think we're already doing it. I think just by you showing up in this room, and you already taking an active step in conscious leadership.

In fact, you asking those questions, also showing, you actually showing, actually interest. In AI led organizations.  The change doesn't happen in the flip. The change happens as a collective effort. Awareness, it happens in our daily interactions. Just think about how OpenAI first released JGPT. I think within 10 days, they have 10 million users.

Is that correct? Something like that? That just shows you when something happens. It's at exponential speed. And when I talk about consciousness is, I think fundamentally, The question about oh what job should I do? How can I get security a really big question is really inside And nobody can answer that for you It's you finding the answer for yourself or why you here what do you want to do?

And what difference do you want it to make one action one choice at a time? 

Anyone else have a burning question they need to get up. Yeah, here we go 

CC I love you. I love you, brother  One of the challenges that I see as we move into this AI world, and you talked about consciousness and connection. When we're talking about building a billion dollar company with only 10 employees.  I see how we can do it in community  online, but how do we get that actual real experience, like you said, of like being in a room and giving hugs when we're reducing the numbers of the team that's creating whatever the output is.

Yeah thank you for I, so I have this bold idea, okay? So right now, our world is constructed by where you work, and then you live not too far from your work in that city, right? So that's current kind of set up.  Imagine that in the future, That you're not live work close to your work. You live where you close you wanted to work But it's a community focus live close to your people.

Yes, you live close to your people So you couldn't work in El Salvador, but you have a local community and the all digital nomads But that's exactly the point of a conjunction a future of work and a future of living Because in the past, they all isolate, and now you can merge in those two areas together.

So you no longer just design which company belongs to, now you can engineer your life in where you wanted to live with your family. So you can literally hit two birds with one stone.  Yeah.  Cici. My summary is turns out you don't need to get all your meaning from work. Just to give you guys a little roadmap where we're headed, Michael Tippett gonna come up and talk a little bit about AI filmmaking.

Shang's gonna give a little beatboxing performance, then we've got our keynote speaker Judy up, and then we're gonna go have wedding cake. So that's where we're going from here. Oh, and we're gonna announce our little 10, 000 hackathon as well. Kevin? So do you wanna do Michael or Shang first?

I wanna do Michael first, then Shang, then Judy.  Okay, guys. Some of you guys might know this face. He's been around for 20 years ran a company called now public that sold back in the day. Entrepreneur, creative technologist, friend partners with Kate Armstrong, who spoke here with Kevin Friel, who's a art curator, AI art curator. 

I love people. This is a very unique moment, y'all. If you're not out there planting your flag in the ground like Simon is with the biosciences here in BC or like Michael is with Filmmaking and AI I think you're more like Quanna was with prompt engineering and running his own machines And there's you're missing the boat You got to find your little space and fucking own it and Michael's done the best job of almost anybody I've ever met in the last like year and a half of wrapping his head around a space that intrigues him putting his flag in the ground and then rolling out the infrastructure to support that.

So he's running a AI film festival, AI film services. He's an artist himself, and he's got a little renegade political project going on right now. You welcome to talk about your work and show your clip, bro. All right.  Thanks, Kris Krüg. Wow. What a flattering. Am I standing in the right area here? Yeah, Kris Krüg and I have known each other for like over 20 years.

I started in the news business here and ran a citizen journalism site called now public and we actually shared an office together. And I've always believed in the importance of news. And but I think that we're at a time now where it's also important to understand the role that mythology plays and guiding the way people think. 

And so the thing I'm going to show you guys here is an attempt to create or begin the conversation about what the mythology of Canada is. I think it's we're in a really important time now in Canadian history in terms of Who we are and what we hope to achieve as a country and our relationship to our southern neighbor who seems to have lost its fucking mind.

And so Mr. Canada is an attempt to insert this slight, slightly absurd figure, Mr. Canada, Mr Canada. ca. And so he goes around the country and talks to all the various politicians and power brokers and important people about what the future of Canada is and along the way has a lot of fun and drives like giant monster trucks and does feats of strength and is just generally an absurd character.

I think what we're going to show here is a promo for episode five which drops this weekend and there's four episodes up on youtube. There are only a couple minutes each. So 

sure, my process so  So yeah, so this is like just this is a one minute promo of a episode that would last probably It's in production right now, but it'll probably be about five or six minutes  And the process is generally, you create the world, you create the characters I train a model on all the main characters, and so I can put them in all kinds of crazy situations, and then they have dialogues, and so there's some lip syncing.

Sometimes the lip syncing is really good, sometimes it's really bad. I think that's kind of part of the charm of AI, is just how It's strange and weird it can look. And so try and incorporate that into the stories. But yeah, so I just, I make it up as I go along every episode.

I don't really know where I'm going when I start. And I don't know what the next one's going to be when I finish the first one. And I think I think AI filmmaking is a lot like software development in the sense that It's iterative, and so the way software used to work, which was my old world, is you'd have this kind of waterfall process and it's now much more iterative where you make it up as you go along and you can go back and add scenes and add characters and take them out applying an iterative software process to filmmaking, yeah, I think that's my time, so should we roll? Alright, I will. So 

And the the the soundtrack is also available on Spotify if you want to download it.  Thank you, Michael. My favorite thing about AI right now is that, your shit's better than the last episode. It's way better than the last episode.  It's crazy. Changes every day. Really amazing. The Jagmeet Singh deepfake there, man.

Wow.

A month ago, I went up to Whistler and I got to give a talk at the Whistler Institute about the future of the creative industries in British Columbia and A. I. And it was a really interesting chance to showcase a lot of your guys work and talk about what you're all are up to, as well as articulate a vision for how people can support.

What we're up to,  like Allah the incubator and accelerator for BC that we're talking about. During that time I met Judy. She was sitting in the front row and asking the best questions. And she's actually not speaking next. Next is Jackson Wu Shyang, our my beatboxing artist friend who also is like a public speaking coach.

But I just wanted you to be able to come do your thing and then I wanted you to come be able to do your thing and just like without an introduction or whatever, right? She's an amazing, accomplished woman. She ask me the best questions about intuition and empathy as it relates to AI. And she really stumped me in front of a room full of 200 people.

And I was like, I want to hear you talk more. And that's why I invited her here. Also, if I heard you right, you turned down a consulting gig with Neuralink because you didn't quite believe in what they were up to and stuff. And so I don't think that's maybe part of what you're talking about tonight, but I found that a very intriguing part of your story.

Neuralink is Elon Musk's company that wants to do brain implants. Judy teaches neuroscience at UBC. So anyway, I'm very excited to have her share with us tonight, but before that, I just want to offer you a little palate cleanser in the form of Jackson Wu Shyang, my beatboxing homie. Him and I are up to all sorts of interesting explorations and experiments as it relates to AI with the human voice and visuals and performance and stuff.

But yeah, Jackson, come do your thing, bro.  And then Judy, please come up after that.  Testing, one, two, three, hello everybody, how are we doing?  Woo!  Nice to see everybody again. I'm dressed wildly differently than this photo of me right now, but that is in fact me. This photo was taken by, I'm not sure if she's out here today, but Michelle Diamond's an incredible photographer.

Before I do anything Cool. I just want to shout out these lights over here. I want to let you bring your attention to these these lights were set up by Kevin. And as you may have noticed there at the event they have been changing colors based off.  different sounds, right? As we're speaking.

But what's really cool about them is that they actually respond to music and percussion as well. So as I go,  wait, is it changing? 

Different textures actually control these lights. So I thought that was pretty cool. But today what I'm going to do, and I'm going to stand in the middle as well, because this is where everything happens. I am a performance artist and one of the things that I specialize in is in vocal percussion, which is beat boxing.

There are no special effects on this mic, but what you are about to hear is completely coming out of my mouth. So let's just Jump right into it. 

Move your body like this. 

This like that. 

Move your body like this, like that, like  a 

little bit of drums. 

Thank you so much.

 Jackson Wu, ladies and gentlemen, shang. 

Yes, sir. 

I have been doing this for 15 years.  So since  the  someone said, December 22nd was the first time chat GPT was mentioned to you, Kris Krüg, apparently, that may have, I think I legitimately think I started around like November of 2010.  Something like that. Do you jam with other musicians?  He runs a hip hop festival. 

I, yes, I do. Sorry to answer your question, yes I have. And can I film? Yeah, man, I'm just here because Michelle Diamond just showed up with her camera. Oh, sweet! Yeah, I want to be next to her. I'm holding a water bottle here. Yeah, just real quick I've always been fascinated with exploring humanity's oldest instrument, which is the human voice.

So right now, me and a couple of other good friends, we run a local organization called the West Coast Groove. And so what we do is we bring awareness to vocal percussion, beatboxing, collaboration, all that good stuff. And we throw a lot of different beatboxing events across the city.  Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

Yesterday at Nook, Jackson gave a public speaking workshop for 20 people. So this is like the beatboxing thing is a part of his whole public speaking persona. And he goes back and forth teaching about how you can get over anxiety, gain confidence and find your voice. That was a fucking fun workshop, bro.

Thank you very much. Thank you so much for having me guys Yeah, thank you so much chris as always 

The only reason i'm not introducing her properly is how do you introduce somebody who has such a vast experience? I could never do you justice judeous. Thank you so much. Please come say hello 

Thank you. I guess you  can use it, No, I'd love it to go away, actually. I actually am going to stand in the dark, because I want you to be able to see my slides. I have never given a talk after a beatboxer.  Don't you want to hear more of him than listen to me? That was amazing. Amazing. In the past hour or so, I've heard some really interesting themes. 

That I hope I can bring back to you. But I heard brain fix, I heard rights, I heard agency, I heard healthcare, I heard anticipation, futures, leadership, authenticity, passion. I've heard that all night and even before. And all about advanced technology. And these are themes that I didn't know I was gonna hear about.

I'm a newbie to this community. But I really appreciate that they precede me and what I hope to share with you in the next ten minutes or so. So I'm a neuroscientist. I'm a professor of neurology at UBC. My specialization is in neuroethics. This is a field that was  designed or created about 25 years ago to explicitly align  Human values and human priorities alongside advances in neurotechnology.

There were a few of us who got together who thought, philosophers and legal scholars have been thinking about mind and brain for a really long time.  But it's time for people within the neurosciences to take on that ethics charge and think about it from the inside out. And so I want to talk a little bit about that with you today.

It's really like the sixty foot, 60, 000 foot layer of what we're going to be looking at and talking about what I could possibly share with you. But maybe we'll have some time afterwards to follow up. Kevin and I are going to work together on my slides and Kevin's going to be my remote.  So thank you for anticipating that.

So this is Kris Krüg at the Whistler Institute, about a month ago in Whistler. And I was just so fascinated to hear about all the work that this community, all of you, are doing and the leadership that BC is providing on the AI landscape. And I did, in fact, Challenge Kris Krüg and asked about where humility and human intuition intersect with AI.

And then we ended up having a very long evening together speaking with one another with my husband, Mike Vanderloos, who's here with a Silicon Valley venture capitalist from from California about where these concepts might intersect. And so that's what I want to share with you today, and we'll go to the next slide. 

And so the first thing I want to talk about is responsibility. And I think responsibility comes with possibility. And so we're going to go into a quick little history lesson about neuroscience before we could ever talk about where AI and neuroscience and brain technologies in particular all come together in this beautiful stew of Ideas and possibilities.

So we'll go to the next slide. And let me just share with you that this year 2025 is the 60th anniversary of modern neuroscience, people have been interested in the brain for a really long time, like long enough to be thinking about the  Sumerians in 4000 B. C. who first noticed the euphoric effects of the poppy plant. 

The papyrus that gave us the first written record of the nervous system. And just to remind you, when we talk about the central nervous system, we're talking about the brain and the spinal cord. We have the first description of 500 BC of the optic nerve, right? The nerve that allows us, that gives us vision and allows us to see.

And even Hippocrates, to whom we attribute The Oath of Ethics in Medicine and Health Care actually talked about epilepsy as a brain disturbance as early as 360 B. C. Let's go on super fast forward in time. Who doesn't love a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci who used to rob graves for for his art?

Business. And so he loved brains, as I love brains and the central nervous system, and he also of course created beautiful art depictions of other parts of the human anatomy, and he would in fact Take the cadavers. He would dissect them together with his colleagues and we believe he would restore them to their grave sites.

And this is just one, one image from his brain drawings of which there are many to enjoy if you if you look them up. Let's go to a next slide. Now, who doesn't love a beautiful brain cell in the brain? And this is one that was drawn by Ramon y Cajal. Who's considered the father of modern neuroscience, he won the Nobel Prize for his depictions.

This is a cell called a kinji cell, populates the back of the brain in an area called the cerebellum that allows us to have coordinated movements along with other cells in the human brain. So 1852 is where we have Ramon y Cajal, and through his death in 1934. A tremendous scholar, and also a mentor for young people interested in the neurosciences.

He just really laid it. He gave it all. He really gave it all. Let's go on to the next slide. So now, fast forward to today. This is a beautiful slide of cells of the brain in the visual cortex. Ocular Dominus columns also allowing us to see these are cells using optical imaging produced by colleagues at the Allen Institute.

Let's go on.  And I ask the question, why did these ancients and those who preceded us, and why today are we so interested in studying the human brain? What's up? It is who we are. It is what makes us agents and have identities and personalities and be unique. And the same and distinct from one another.

And so there's an element of curiosity at the end of the day, but there also is an element of wanting to discover why we behave the way we do, how we interact with one another, how we're empathic  with one another, why we love, why we hate.  And so we can, we go on with our studies to think about how we respond to external stimuli, as well as internal stimuli.

There are different ways that we can do that, and let's go to the next slide. EEG recordings have been around, it probably was one of the first ways of imaging the human brain that I can think of. Radiography was, is old, is probably 120 years old. Hans Berger in the 1920s actually created Electrical images of the brain using electrodes far fewer and less sophisticated than these here on the right.

We see some images of recordings from the brain from the shown by the IEEE. These are some aluminum high density channels, 128 channels on the brain. that give us electrical signals from the brain. I was around I won't tell you how long ago, but let's just say this is a kind of a modern contraption to putting electrodes, 256 channels on the brain.

You can plop them on with a really good glue. When I was doing this in my 20s, we actually had to scrape the scalp one by one with the end, the sharp end of a Q tip. And by the time you got to 250, number one was pretty dry. So it took a while, but we got the job done. Each of these channels will actually give a unique signal from the brain, even though they seem that they're so close together.

Let's go on to the next slide. So I'm going to show you this really dated slide, and it's really not to brag, it's just really funny. So when I was doing this high density imaging work, recording electrical signals from the brain, one of the things we were interested in was how to predict human performance accuracy.

We did a pretty good job of it, and I'll go to the next slide. But I just want to show you, in 1999, And this was modern AI technology. It looks so hokey to me today, it's just, I'm almost embarrassed to show it to you. But we were using covariance patterns from signals acquired from different channels on the brain, and then using colors and thicknesses to show how they related to one another.

And in fact, these were one of the first images of what we call today, The human connectome, the networks in the brain that all work together to allow us to be who we are, to respond to internal and external stimuli. And we have beautiful, far more beautiful images than this. Kevin, you're on. Such as this, and this is the connectome.

It is gorgeous, isn't it? And it really shows the way that the different parts of the brain are connected. These are pathways described by the way the water is organized in the brain by colleagues down in Los Angeles and funded by, and I want to give a shout out to the NIH, that's really Having a hard go at things right now, enabled by funding from the National Institutes of Health, bringing these kind of beautiful images and discoveries to life for us today.

Let's go on. There's another reason that we want to study the brain. So we have curiosity, we want to understand how people how people behave and why they behave the way they do. And of course, those of us working in the field, especially in healthcare want to help alleviate the burden of neurologic and psychiatric disease on a worldwide scale.

And here you see I just took this from the website of the World Health Organization, that the number and cost of neurologic diseases today is just immense. And let's just go on. We've been using AI since probably the 70s and 80s and of course in the 90s to try to develop technologies to alleviate diseases of the brain like Parkinson's disease and other kinds of diseases.

That involve the neurodegeneration of cells and pathways in the brain, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is actually a target of some of the studies of Neuralink today. And this is just a beautiful slide from the Cleveland Clinic. Let's go on. We are also able to use imaging of the way that blood is oxygenated in the brain and the brain uses sugars.

Two specific regions when a human person is responding to a certain stimuli, also technology enabled by AI, and this is a very simple bold, so blood oxygenation level dependent experiment showing what happens when somebody simply moves a limb, like fingers, on command. But imagine if AI, next slide Kevin, thank you. 

In a  supercharged context, and this is where AI is really playing a role in helping us to understand human consciousness. Now imagine that you know someone or you have a loved one  who is in a disordered state of consciousness where they are unable to respond clinically. to your requests or your commands.

They seem to be in a coma like or persistent vegetative state. Now imagine, with our oxygen level measurements, or our electro measurements, or our heat measurements, we could actually use AI to seduce, as a proxy signal, or to produce a proxy signal, that there is actually some kind of intention going on.

In the braids of those individuals who are unable to respond to our clinical exam. And imagine if we use those proxy signals  and allowed someone to express their desire as to whether they want to continue or discontinue treatment. Or whether they want to live or to die. This is the kind of power that we're seeing.

In the A. I. Space and that all of you are innovating and contributing to today. No, 

no, it's a good question. That's Wanda, right? I don't know. Maybe my colleagues here. Do we have a I studies of imaging of Alzheimer's? Where?  Intentions of an Alzheimer's person have been decoded using A. I. I can't think of a study, but I don't know why the technology could not go in that direction.

We certainly see A. I. studies of a memory dysfunction, for example. There was a recent study of changes in memory in people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. So Alzheimer's is a little bit different because there's a downward pattern ultimately.  A degenerative pattern. So it's an excellent question.

Thank you. Thank you for being so bold and interrupting me. I love it. No, I like it. I like being challenged. Okay, my group knows. Okay, let's go on. Oh, yes. And there's also this commercial application where you can go and buy gadgets in big box stores to try to stimulate your brain to make you, ooh, this projector is about to die.

Think faster. Respond faster. Respond more accurately. And if I could have my props, please. Thank you. These are the kind of gadgets I acquire, people give me gifts these days, so I books and gadgets. This is a really old school one, you can see it even has the electrodes, a whole bunch of electrodes attached to them.

And, Mike, I'm gonna give you this. This is actually a Canadian made headset.  And it's pretty cool. I like it. And so I'll just say, these kinds of wearable devices really can  give you feedback about the kind of state that you're in, whether you're resting, whether you're excited like I am to be here with you, whether you're a little intimidated.

There are different kinds of brain signals that these gadgets will actually produce. What they won't do, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, thank you very much, that they're going to tell you what I'm about to tell you next. They just don't have that kind of capability. So they're good at giving us emotional signals or reading emotional signals.

Some have been introduced for trying to help people think better. Especially kids with reading disorders, dyslexia, autism and so forth. But they're not so good at mind control as sometimes we see in the media. Oop, thank you. We're gonna go on and try to get through this before the projector dies on me.

Next slide please. With possibility comes humility. Is there anything we can do about the slides?  Okay, if anybody has epilepsy, just, can you just leave for a few minutes and then I'll tell you when you can come back. Because we don't want to have a clinical crisis.

 In my talk we, we hate that, when that happens. 

Reimagine themselves as a creativity and innovation hub. And by us doing this kind of stuff here, we add to their whole credibility around this stuff. Hopefully we'll soon get a new projector for them. Okay, alright. Applause Shout out to the Space Center getting at least a new bulb. Okay so  After Kris Krüg and I started talking about humility and intuition, I absolutely couldn't let it go.

And I also didn't know he was going to invite me to give this talk. So this is just very special for me. What do I mean by humility? Next slide, Kevin.  I think about as we innovate, as you innovate in your AI space. It's thinking about and learning from lessons of the past, scrutinizing authentically and with passion your design, whether it's scientific or it's creative or it's commercial,  promising to the limits of promise and not over sensationalizing, being transparent and about what you're doing, what the promises are, as well as what the limitations are.

We all have a lot to learn from each other, including where our failures exist. We have as much to learn from our failures as we have to do from the successes of one another.  Follow through is super important, especially when it comes to patients who, or people you may enroll in your studies. You gotta stick by them.

You can't just abandon people once they've given of themselves to to assist you in your work. And then communication and outreach like this. We need to talk to one another, and we need to be out in the public, ensuring the public understands what's going on in our space, what's real, and what's Memorex.

And What we need to really look forward to in the future. Next slide, please. Oh, I just want to say there's a lot of governance and discourse going around in the world. World Health Organization around brain technologies is particularly interested in health. Next slide. UNESCO is particularly interested in science and education and where neurotechnology will intersect with with the future and regulation.

Next slide. Just as a heads up. UNESCO has a wonderful publication on, specifically on ethics and AI. Those of you in this community will, I imagine, will be very interested in reading that. Next slide. There are other players in the world. Amnesty International is really interested in the rights based questions around brain technologies.

And one of the things that they're dancing with is whether we need new human rights frameworks.  to regulate neurotechnology as including how it involves A. I. Or, and whether there should be criminal codes. There's a movement around the world now to criminalize innovators if they step across the line of privacy data hijacking or so, or, and so forth.

So it's the rights argument and the rights debates are very hot right now. You might want to tune into those if you're interested. Next slide.  This is a wonderful community. I don't know what's going to happen to it in the next few weeks.  I have to say, but the FDA got together with people of academic institutions and industry and patient stakeholders to talk about brain computer interfaces.

These are implantable devices in the brain. To help people with Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, and so forth. And it is a collaborative, truly collaborative community. I hope we can stand and withstand some of the pressures around us now. And finally, in this segment, thank you, Kevin, colleagues, and I created principles.

for innovation in neurotechnology using STS science technology in society, principles around responsible innovation, and we published that in the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, and you can find it easily, or you can just ask me and I'll push it to you. That's my sh my thing around humility, and we're gonna come to the end, and what happens  With humility.

We also need human intuition. And what do I mean by that? And human intuition, Kris Krüg, continuing our conversation is the human override, where we look at the output of your AI algorithms, machine learning algorithms. And you say, is this real? Does this really make sense? Does it compute? And there's one thing that there's very little that's black and white in ethics, but it's the following principles, Kevin, it's.

Ensuring that we do good, ensuring that we respect each other, we ensure that people own, have the right to their own data, and that it's not taken away from us without our permission, and that we have decision making capacity within  a scenario of our cultural background, our belief systems, our values, and priorities. 

With that said, 

With that said, I want to give a shout out to my amazing group, Make a Little Bit of Noise.  There we go, you guys are Talking about passion, this is a team that, It just exudes passion day in and day out. I'm so privileged to work with them. Shout out to the Musqueam Squamish and Tsleil Waututh people for giving us the privilege of being here at the MacMillan Center with its good projector on these beautiful lands. 

And to Mary Ann Bakani, whose beautiful graphics I was able to share with you today. At the end of the day, last slide for brains, technology, and AI.  I feel it's about responsibility, intuition, and humility, and the future is in our hands. Let's see where we take it. Thanks so much. 

Thank you, Judy. Beautiful presentation. Hang on for a sec. We got some questions from the audience.  But we have a special facilitator of the Q& A. I'd like to invite Mike up to the stage.  Oh, fun. 

You guys are going to share that one. I'm going to be the guy that runs around. Mike, will you facilitate some Q& A for five minutes? Sure, yes. Maybe introduce yourself real quick. Okay, I'm Mike Vanderloos. I'm recently retired from UBC in mechanical engineering, where I had the privilege of running a robotics lab and also I'm working a bit in roboethics.

Thanks. You can guess where that came from.  Okay. Who has a burning, who has a burning question here?  Now they do. Okay. Koush, man,  I was coming to you, Koush, for the wrap up later, but I'm so excited you raised your hand.  Okay, yes. Yeah, thank you so much for that absolutely, I'm right here. For that absolutely informative and inspiring talk.

I'm gonna look into some of the more recent research. Again, I've been always very interested. I almost purchased the OpenBCI headset, 10 years ago and so on. And I'm wondering At some point, I have two kind of questions. One is more philosophical and or political. I don't know. One is more technical You mentioned don't read into these headsets too much.

They're mostly, can tell you some good signals from your brain  And yes, I don't know about mind control so much the output side, but the input side, but the output side What do you think of the fMRI to image? The image stable diffusion style models being used to extract imagery out of brains, how effective do you think that is to have you yourself found it to be somewhat progressing at a good rate and  this is the more technical side of it.

And what do you, what do your perspective as a practitioner? And the other is like more, do you think. Research like this should be afforded, enabled for people like myself and like just people to do on themselves, like ethically just on themselves, or should there be criminalized and devices like EEG or whatever else be made harder to, access and so on.

I find this a movement like that is happening in my other space of LLMs and AI. More and more people are trying to be private and closed source and not open. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are. Should people be enabled to do this? And build upon and contribute. Okay, thank you for that series of questions.

Kris Krüg, you might have to bring the wedding cake into the room. Those are the first positive things he's meetups. This guy  That means he like, that means he likes you. Okay, of you earlier, so I'm waiting for one of those to go, to come through. 

Okay. You asked a lot of questions. In no particular order I don't believe in criminalization in the scientific arena. There is occasionally a nefarious actor in our space.  I don't I am so much of a proponent of professional self regulation through our communities, through our professional societies.

And just in terms of cooperating  with one another, I really don't want to see criminal codes interfering with innovation, particularly because I think they'll interfere with innovation, that's for the benefit in the clinical arena. And we have a lot to solve in the clinical arena. So that's number one. I hope that was helpful.

BCIs, I was around, this is also going to date me, but there's, now you have a lot of information about how old I am. When I don't know if you're old enough to know. There was a time that CT scans were being sold in the open marketplace. Do you, are you old enough to know that?

Okay so this was a movement. It started in California and then it actually spread all over the United States and even came up to Canada. Where you could go and you could purchase for yourself a CT scan. You could go to like the shopping mall, and you could have A head scan, a lung scan and you purchase it for yourself without prescription.

You could have as many as you wanted because there was no regulation around it. You could have spring specials and Mother's Day specials. a colonoscopy and a head scan in one shot. So that kind of went a little bit out of control. So I think there are limits to do it yourself technology. I think some of these wearable headsets, as long as you are informed, and you have the, are given the right information about what they can and cannot do,  are fine.

We as humans innovate all the time, right? That's how we got the wheel, that's how we got fire, so now we have headsets. If people want to use signals from their brain, To regulate I love to do yoga, but maybe somebody wants to wear a headset and regulate their breathing and their anxiety level.

Some of them actually absolutely do work like that.  Do we need to be afraid of over reading signals? So you can't have for yourself an fMRI scan, right? This is a big, long little machine. Three tests there are portable MRIs now that are being rolled out. Less field strength, but still, they still require an infrastructure.

Am I worried about controlling people through brain technologies? I'm less worried about it, and I think as a Canadian neuroscience community and neuroethics community, we are less worried about it than perhaps other countries. There's a lot of hype around this in the south. Now they're a bit distracted, but they're There's a lot of worry about that there.

There are, there is advances in speech decoding from people who have brain computer interfaces and a degenerative disease that doesn't allow them to communicate. But these are limited, very constrained environments, laboratory environments, single person, maybe a few person experiments. There's a long way to go before you or ever I, or you or I will ever have to worry about walking on the street and having our thoughts  Borrowed, hijacked, manipulated.

Maybe it'll happen. But I don't think it's a today problem. Just perhaps a footnote. I remember a paper you wrote that a picture is worth a thousand words. But which one's valid? Pictures are really sexy. And they can be made to be manipulated. They can be made to look as if they are real.

When actually it's just a shimmer.  So it's, like what you said, it goes exactly to this point, is that you have to be, you have to know how to interpret the images that you get and take it with a big grain of salt. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. James, I'll pass the mic over to you there. Yeah, thank you. I've got a question about problems we've seen in social media around algorithms that, Feed you what you want, and feed your brain that that, that sugar high that it loves.

And AI seems to be a yes man. Likes to give you answers, makes you feel good.  How do you see, can, do you I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and where you see this maybe going, and the ethics around it.  Maybe that'll be my title of my next talk, The Candy Cane of AI for the Brain, or,  it's not bad.

It's not bad. Okay. I have two, maybe two answers. One is that we do know that social media use theories from neuroscience that we've learned about addiction, right? Social media and getting people to click constantly is very much based on release of dopamine in the brain. The more you release the more you want, right?

That's how it goes. So there is a neuroscience of getting people to use social media and it's very AI driven, right? These are algorithms that are purely driven by AI. So I think that's a good thing. We're seeing a lot of mental health disorders, particularly among our youth today. So I think there has been maybe a lack of anticipation of where that could go wrong.

And it's always hard to shove the horse back in the barn, right?  It's impossible. So what we have to do is be proactive now, and  authentically addressing the fact that there is a problem and we need to deal with it. There is one thing I want to share with you about social media,  that it's a space I keep tapping, I keep poking the bear, but I haven't yet So Kris Krüg brought up the conversation that I had with Neuralink, it was actually now many years ago, they came to me asking pursuing whether I'd be able to offer them ethics advice as they were advancing.

There were a number of reasons I turned them down. The principal one that I shared with them was that they really needed somebody in the U. S. regulatory space, not somebody in the Canadian regulatory space, and I didn't feel that I could serve them as well as somebody else. There are other reasons, but I think that was a completely top level, level one.

There's one thing that worries me, though, about what's going on with companies like Neuralink. They're not the only ones. A sort of seem to be on our radar, and they are using social media to recruit patients to their clinical trials.  And we've never seen that before. So companies that are outside the academic sector and don't get public funding are excluded from ethics oversight. 

So in UBC and all of the institutions and academic institutions have ethics boards, because we receive public funding. That provides a tremendous amount of oversight in terms of what we can and cannot do. Neuralink now is starting to open trials in Toronto with neurosurgeons there and their oversight is the University Health Network.

And I was just talking with the Canadian press, a reporter from the Canadian press the other day, and she was asking whether an institution like University of Toronto and that University Health Network can provide the oversight needed to ensure that the trials will be done properly in Ontario. And I, my answer was emphatically yes. 

What we don't have a good handle on is how people are being recruited in whatever it is, 140 characters or 280 characters now. And there are very, we have very strong rules around how we can recruit people to our studies, but there are no rules around recruiting to social media that I know of. And so when a company is recruiting  to, at the same trial, people with a spinal cord injury that's acquired from a trauma, and that stabilizes over time, and at the same  X thing, I don't know what it's called now, it used to be a tweet, now it's an X thing recruiting people who are suffering from a fatal neurodegenerative  disease, there's a disconnect for me, and that makes me very nervous.

And whereas we know that consent forms, we've all signed them, are too long and too laborious and completely need to be blown up, this other way of recruiting through these very cryptic,  not really transparent processes are equally concerning. I hope that answered your question, if not we'll talk afterwards.

Let's give it up for Judy. Applause Mike. I hope to have you back here sometime to give your own take on what's going on around here.  If you guys came here for the film screening that we did, the thinking game two weeks ago, you know that these conversations could go for hours. In fact, I almost wasn't able to have this event here because we let the Q& A go too long at the film screen.

So thank you for letting me cut you off. Judy Ellis, if you want to connect with her, got her whole students here. She's here. I can connect you with her as well. She's up to some very interesting things. Thank you for dropping your knowledge here tonight. Beautiful presentation. Amazing. 

for being a part of this.  Yo, we got some wedding cake over there that we want to serve for our buddy Irish James who got married in Florida last week. But before we do, I've been like being coy. I'm super fucking excited about this thing we're about to drop upon you. Some of you guys were here last month when my friend Andrew, who runs RivalTech, came up and was trying to ask you guys to experiment with his data and his market research.

We've developed that into a program and he backed it with 10, 000. And starting today and running every two months for the next four months, eight months, sorry, four cycles, we're gonna do a hackathon design challenge where he gives us some original data and we try to turn it into different Visualizations, analyzations, ways of looking at traditional market research data using AI, using VR, XR, whatever, right?

Any of us can form teams up to three, all this stuff's gonna be online, but we're gonna be giving away 2, 500 at the meetup two months from now, 2, 500 after that, and for the next four cycles. So Brittany, you wanna come up, talk about the program, tell what's going on, and yeah.  Vancouver AI Data Storytelling Hackathon. 

Hello, I'm back.  Woman of many hats. Judy, first of all, I just wanted to say that was incredible. 

Also, as someone who was a practicing neuroscientist for about a decade, out at I Corps having my husband go I remember this paper you wrote, is my dream.  The cutest.  Okay. The Hackathon. If you guys were here last month, you heard me talk about the assignment that I'm making my students do and how I'm very vague about my assignments.

I'm like, I'm not giving you guidelines. I don't want to influence your thinking. And we are going to give you  a, actually, first of all, is Dale in the room?  Yeah, Dale, stand up. Okay, so this is sponsored by Rival Tech, Rival Technologies, who also has, runs Reach 3, which is a marketing platform? Oh, sorry.

Marketing Insight Platform. Is that right? And we have Dale here as our representative. Thank you. Huge round of applause to them for sponsoring this. You can sit down now if you want. If you have things to add to this that I am not covering, you are more than welcome to. But I also know there's cake.

The quick thing. We are going to collect data on a set of questions that I made up. And for those of you who have interaction with me at all, you should be worried. So I made up a set of questions. They are absolutely useless in the term, in terms of future marketing. But they're fun. And so you will get the responses to these questions.

You will then create a story. A realistic story. Something that is not sensationalized because although we may tune in to the US news for funsies, that's not a real way to make decisions or form opinions. So you are going to actually create a data based, data driven story  in whatever form you want. If you can  somehow incorporate AI and interpretive dance your way, through effectively communicating data, be our guest.

You'll have about two to five minutes for it to come forward. It needs to be digestible within that amount of time.  It can be, again, I don't want to guide your thinking, it can be anything. It has to involve AI but that's the only guideline beyond AI, five minutes, max. You'll have,  we should have the data to you within about a week.

And then you will have another six weeks to get her done.  And,  then we will judge, and we will show the shortlist as well as announce the winner at the, what month is it now? The April,  at the April meetup. Yes, question.  Criteria of judgment. Let me see if I can remember this off the top of my head. 

Yes Creativity and novelty. Effectiveness of story. Technical execution. And, also there's something else. Scan the QR code. It's all in there, I promise. Yeah, scan the QR code. There is more info there. Also, if you do intend to participate, I  Registration isn't mandatory because there's no registration fee you can just submit.

However, it would really help us if you registered, if you do intend to submit just because we will then have a sense of what we're getting ourselves into here. This is new.  It's a lot of money. We are really excited to see what you guys come up with. I think there's another question in the back.

This one, the opening question is a hot dog a sandwich? There's a bunch of standard market research questions you might ask 

Asian using a hot dog. Yeah. And your only  stipulation is you have to have come to one 

meeting that can connect with your people in Singapore, Saudi Arabia, America, wherever you want. If you've been here one time, form a team. So after this money, we're just trying to invent new ideas of looking at a big stack of log files of data and reinterpret them through AI. It's real money, 10 G's, 2, 500 every two months, starting now.

If you've got questions, I'll guide you. I can't form a team, Brittany can't form a team, you can't form a team, but other than that, everyone else can form a team. 

We're aiming for about 500 completed surveys. So not massive about 10 questions per survey and some demographic data on top of that. These are good. These are logistical questions and they're important.  Yeah, there's, again, no real guidelines for the format of your submission. You can do whatever you want.

Our aim with the data set was to make it something that no one would have a sort of background advantage using. And,  again, you 

They don't want a company or a company. This is a 

model for you to take your ideas and build a company or a whole thing out of it, right? They don't own our shit. They're just trying to  collaborate with us for the best ideas we can come up with. 

AI is new and everyone is tired of 60 page PowerPoints. And so let's do something more interesting.  Thank you, Brittany. I've never actually asked anyone to share shit up here before, but if you guys would share this with the world, I think it's important, right? A lot of people are talking about building the AI ecosystems here in Canada or BC.

But, there's not a lot of people who are like running real programs, connecting with real money, and trying to get it back out into the hands of the people, thank you very much for being a part of this. Thanks for coming tonight. Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Brittany. Thanks for everyone who showed up.

We got birthday cake and drinks still. The bar's open. At 9. 40. No, we got wedding cake, bro. James, Irish James, got married last week in Florida. I was there. He's a big part of this community. He couldn't make it back tonight because of a flight delay, but we made him a wedding cake anyway. I got a couple requests.

Clean up around you, even if it's not your shit. They usually don't let people drink in here, but they let us eat and drink in here. And they only do that based on our behavior. Make it, oh,  Wanda.  Thank you for the donation to our organization. We got a couple sponsors, I shouted them out earlier, but we also got a couple benefactors, and Wanda's one of them.

This woman's written like 2, 000 business plans for BC Company. She's amazing, she's tapped into the scene that's going on here, and she supports what we're doing. Thank you so much. 

Seriously.  The asks for nothing donation, but just keep doing what you're doing. It's very helpful. Thank you so much Wanda.  Hey guys, thanks for all being a part of this. I appreciate you being here.  Stay in touch on the internet.
