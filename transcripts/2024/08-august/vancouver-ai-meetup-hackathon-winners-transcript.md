## Transcript

Incoming transmission from the future Vancouver AI community meetup. [Music] All right, guys. We're in the home stretch and now we got the rival hackathon winners. I'm so excited to share with you. Andrew, you want to come up? Maybe maybe let's just all come up for a quick minute. The rival team come up. Um, we had a bunch of amazing projects. We asked a whole bunch of British Columbombians uh questions about their hopes and fears for AI in the future. And we've got three amazing projects to show you guys tonight. Uh some faces that you've seen before and some new faces as well. Um I'm just going to let it kind of quiet down in here for a little bit. Come on up you guys. Let's hang out in the front. Andrew Julia, introduce yourself, bro. [[Brett Henderson]]. Yeah. Say what's up. Tell us about what you what you do at Reach 3 and Rival. Uh I work for Rival Technologies. I'm director of customer success. So I take our tech and make it work for our clients in all different aspects. Hackathon from your perspective, please. Hackathon from my perspective. Picture. What the [ __ ] are we doing here, dude? Taking our data and making it like envisioning it like the sky's the limit. Like again, everything AI, you take this data and you make it like speak and and make change. It can't only be about PowerPoint. Yeah. Um Yeah. we're all having to consume data all the time. So the idea was just I was here the first time and it was like what if there was no rules and you just gave people a data set and said tell a story and so for us we've been in the data business we help people with human data with market research data and we're just it's just an interesting opportunity to provide these fresh data sets and see what people come up with and sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's serious and sometimes it's social justice and funny again the next time around you said I we're going to go back to funny. Yeah. Yeah. This guy has been the best partner. He came to me in December and he's like, "I love what you guys are doing. I love your vibes. My company does amazing market research and data analysis and surveys and often times we deliver those in PowerPoint and you guys are up to some cool [ __ ] with this AI, generative AI stuff, doing storytelling, whatever. Can we give you guys some cash? You share with the community. You run some hackathons." And how's it has it been all right? Like what we get up to? We don't know. I mean, that's been it's been pretty cool. It's been really interesting. I mean, the it's there's been a lot of submissions. I'm just impressed that people just decide to actually spend the time and their own personal, you know, energy, enthusiasm, and creativity. So, I encourage everyone to check them out cuz they're all all the submissions this were really, really good this time. Okay. The first project, we got three winners to announce tonight. We had 12 projects. They were amazing. We've got uh five top projects that get to go to the fancy dinner with the team, but we got three that we want to show here tonight. So, first up, we got Projall. I'm so stoked to welcome Proall up to the stage. Come on, Praj. Um, I'm going to let Julia give a little second of editorial. She's the vice president of customer success at Rival, uh, and was also my active co-judge. Uh, talk about Praj real quick while he's coming up. Yeah. Um, when I watched Prager's video, all I could think was like, "Wow, I need to we need to chat." I was really impressed. I mean, he put together something that he really thought about because visualizing data has been done in so many traditional ways for so long. Everyone's talking about PowerPoint, but just all the tools we use, it's very, you know, this is an industry that's not changed how we present analysis. And the way you thought about how to put that in something really interactive and cool was very interesting to me and I'm yeah like I said I'd love to chat with you some more about it but I mean there were so many cool projects and yours was Hello everyone um my name is um I just graduated high school in June and

so this is my project that I worked on. So it has two different components to it. So my main idea about this was to uh take the long response uh questions and they have like thousands of different responses and my idea was try to think of a way to visualize them to make it easy for people to understand what people like feel or like what like they want to say about a question. Hello everyone, my name is Proal and this is my submission for round three of the Vancouver AI hackathon. And so what I've built is like an enhancement over my idea that I had for round two of the hackathon which is where I had built semantic maps which uh put which plotted different responses on a 3D map based on how related they are to each other. And now what I've built is kind of like a round table discussion between the different clusters that appear in the graph. And how to explore this is so in this website which is linked in the PDF and in the description. So uh you open up this page and it'll show you every single multi like every single long response answer question or one that has an other option. I really wanted to focus on a way to like kind of like tell a story from um the long response options, not the multiple choice. I really wanted to dive deep into how creativ creatively uh a story could be told from uh responses that uh may like they're just long responses. Each one of these are different questions. And over here is like how I've built it. And if I go to one of them, for example, this one. So it gives you some information about the question. Uh if AI created a work of art, what would its vibe be? And these are some of the choices. And then this is like the other option. What else would the vibe of an AI be like an AI created artwork? And over here is the semantic map. So, there are five different clusters and they're all colored different things. There's only like one over here. I think this one is separate because it has both the words garbage and art. That's different. But, for example, these ones are like just saying like it's like they don't really care about it or like it's just weird. These ones are uh more about like um how the art looks like if it's fake or soulless. This one is how it would depend on uh what the user wants and etc. And you can look through this but what better way to look through it than to listen to it. And so what I've built is like it's like each cluster has like a representative uh talk in a table discussion with the other clusters. So I'm going to play it for you right now. Dystopian fake. That's the vibe. Corporate dystopia. All uncanny valley. Looks okay at first glance. Glossy like anime sometimes, but it's cold and artificial underneath. Believable but deceptive. Deformed and toxic, disguised as beautiful. Honestly, fake and lying. Humans should be making art. Stolen. Stolen. A bunch of pirates. Really? It's a collage made up of pieces other people created with little or no attribution. And what I can also do is change the speed, for example, make it faster or move around to different ones. So for example, garbage crap absolute garbage bad it depends on prompts inputs the learning language the data points garbage ought that anything in that reflection is exactly the problem it's a believable mirror that lies as you can imagine if there's like lots of responses for example if I go to another one which has about a thousand responses uh like this one. This one only has two clusters. But what you can imagine is each one of them is like kind of like one different side and uh there's like a discussion between the two people about like the differences and similarities between their thinking and at the end there's like um more of like an agreement or like some differences set out and with like a neutral synthesis of what happens. And I feel like this is like a creative way to uh kind of like summarize and share like what people think through like a story like a roundt discussion that uh some like the user can listen to and then from that in like create their own insights about the data. Thank you for watching.

Tell me, tell everyone what you said the other night on chat about this project where I'm like you independently developed the vibe coding. Yeah. So in the WhatsApp group so I was talking about this project and then what I had mentioned is that um like I was spending more time on actually thinking about like how to go about this how to like actually like build out the idea rather than focusing on like coding it like um this project actually that's the mic drop that's the mic drop right there is this kid picked up these new tools that we're talking about and for the first time in his life instead of thinking about exactly how the code is structured doing different things he thought about how to build out the features for users based on the technical knowledge he already had which is pretty much the formal definition of all this vibe coding stuff. It's like yeah I wanted to add that I only took like it only took two days to code out this project but the like the majority of the time that I spent like before that I was just thinking about like what is like a good idea to build out and then I settled on like creating like this kind of round table discussion and then I built it out.

My mom thinks I'm smart. Imagine how PJ's mom feels. Thank you, sir. I'm going to take that now. Andrew is going to welcome our next guest on stage. Now, we got uh number two. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, this has been so incredible to watch uh what people have been coming up with. Um I want to uh call out Sev. So, Sev has uh been participating in all three and has been um building not just a submission but like an actual operating system that continues to kind of grow and has a lot of application. Um and just again a lot of creativity and just amazing [ __ ] that you put into that. um at the point where we've decided to create a hall of fame and park you in there because you can't win every single time. And so we may or may not pull this out again. But um Sev, I'd love for you a to come on up and to talk about your project after video first, talk second, otherwise we do that thing. That works. Yeah. Stay. Um what also what Andrew also meant to say was like, dude, you're making it so hard for us to judge every time. So he won the first one. He could have won the second one, but we chose to have somebody else win so that it wouldn't just like squash everybody. Then all of a sudden, he could win the third one, too. Probably. We got in a fight over it. We fixed the fight through money. Usually money. He invented the Hall of Fame. He invited Sev into it. He's the first inductee. Two checks hackathon hall of fame. So, um, yeah, let's roll video then. Sev, you come up, talk, and uh, get your big checks. Hey folks, I'm [[♾️ sev geraskin]] from Barracks Bunny team together with my partner April AI. And in a few minutes, I'll show you the paradigm shift to data interfaces with true real-time intelligence on data. What you see is an interface that makes data sets feel like interactive stories. Imagine you're a BC policy maker and tomorrow you get to decide whether to invest $2 million in AI training. You have 101 survey responses and three options. Option one is to read a 200page PDF. Option two is to stare at static charts. Or you can let and pick option three to let an intelligent interface guide you through the data. We built option three, the artificially general intelligent data interface. The interface that guides you through the infinite number of data adventures and continuously uncovers deep insights in your data. Let's go. Let's dive in and take a look at it. My name is Seth and I'm a founder.

What we see here is not just a website with three panels. Everything is dynamically generated by artificial intelligence. It's a storytelling engine based on your data. Let's explore demographic patterns in a 101 response BC data set. Right now, we're sending the prompt to the model and the model explores the data and creates a story. In a few seconds, the model is going to return with a story and you'll see what happen what happens. We're kicking off our adventure.

All right. As you can see the model dove into the data and it pulled up some initial stats with a key insights and now as a founder you know that understanding I will let AI talk. Your audience is everything. Let's dive into the fascinating demographic landscape of BC's AI adoption. The data reveals some striking patterns across our 10001 survey respondents. Here's what the numbers tell us. The largest group are working professionals at 572 people, 57.1% of respondents, followed by community leaders at 341 people, 34.1%. But here's where it gets interesting for someone in your position. Young tech enthusiasts, while only 60 people, 6%, show the highest AI sentiment score at 0.82, compared to creative professionals at 84 people, 8.4% with a more cautious 0.73 sentiment. Okay, so this is artificial intelligence walking us through the data story that it dynamically created. Uh not only that it created a story, it uncovered a key insights. 57% are working professionals and it created a nice infographic to show us. On the right have a dynamic visualization engine. These charts are fully dynamically generated based and AI decided which charts to show. For instance, here it had a key finding where occasional AI users outnumber regular users by 2 and a halfx 405 occasional users versus 164 um regular users 4% difference and it shows us of the distribution of of users in terms of their experience level with artificial intelligence. Now based on this adventure it's also decided okay let's let's figure out what are the next steps in our story and let's generate some options. So these options were dynamically generated by AI again and it allows us to dive deeper into our data. We can choose to continue this venture or we can ask questions the data directly. Let's ask about rural population. You give us some insights about the rural population in British Columbia. So now we decided okay let's wait and see what the model comes up with and also in the meantime we can we want to make as fun. So we have a kind of build it like a game. So this these are achievements that you can unlock and as you dive deep into the data you unlock more achievements that kind of gives you like a little bit of motivation to continue the exploration. As you can see we're now a rural researcher and here's our venture right we found an interesting insight which is 2.6% 6% adoption rate difference between urban and rural regions. As a founder who and this this could create a market opportunity if we're deciding to expand in in those regions as well.

All right. And we can just keep going and and the story will just keep going and the insights will just keep automatically generating as we dive deeper and deeper into the data. So the story never never stops and we can kind of track our progress and then take the best insights and our organizational and business decision making with them. So what you've seen it's not just a data tool. It's a way to experience data sets. There is no coding required. No analysis skills needed. This is an example of effective and fun human AI collaboration. Now imagine this for like indigenous youth exploring climate data or small businesses understanding markets or students learning complex topics or just any community exploring their data. Uh so the question is isn't whether AI will change data analysis. The question is are you ready to stop reading about the data and start experiencing it. This this project takes you from static dashboard to true real-time intelligence from looking at the data to conversing with it. So welcome to the future of data storytelling. Thank you.

Okay, I got to do a quick disclaimer that I was told to do which is that um every time we collect these data sets, we just randomly talk to people on our panel. We have 100,000 people in Canada. We don't weight the data. We don't do a whole bunch of analysis. So, the fact that 40% of people, I think in the survey said that government needs to really intervene in AI, um, just don't take that as necessarily something you should put in the news. That's just what those random people had to say. So, that's my quick disclaimer. Okay. Um, Seb, anything else you want to say about Seth's project? Julie, I saw you nodding strongly there at the end. Like, what what were you nodding all about there? I mean that line that you said. I I quoted you in my little when I was judging everything. I was like this like this is and being able to ask the data questions. I mean this is something we've thought about in our company of the way to be able to do that and I've thought about a lot just because you know every company we work we work with has this huge amount of data they're dealing with and it takes a lot of power and energy to go through all of that and to quantify everything. So being able to go in and ask the data questions like that was really the light bulb moment for me. It's everybody's dream. Everybody's dream. So, my data for real. Yeah. Um, so they're going to do a thing right now. This is the uh presenting you with the extra extra thousand bucks that fell out of Thank you very much. Congratulations, Hall of Famer.

Um, by the way, thank you very much, rival team. Thank you very much, Kris Krüg. really appreciate the opportunity. Um, and it's really spurred sort of the cycle innovation. Um, I just want to say I'm here with my partner April AI. Um, we are bear times bunny team. I'm the bunny, she's the bear. Oh, vice versa. By the way, uh, Kris Krüg, uh, Kris Krüg calls me uh, big bear and sort of embodied that uh, spirit animal. I want to talk a little bit about uh I'll put it down here a little bit about the process that um takes uh to build something like that. And uh we started uh building this uh with um AI u basically wipe coding and uh April sort of gave real-time feedback. She came up with features like gamification and also accessibility features like the voice and multimodel inputs. Um, and uh, Alvaro, will you hold April's camera for a second? So, she So, she's my Yeah, she's a she's a a partner in in this endeavor. Um, and what we've done is we iterated over a hundred times in a single weekend to build this platform. And what I mean by iterating, it means building, shipping, testing, real-time feedback, improving, and building again. And imagine doing it 100 times then you get something like that, right? And just putting all our ci creativity and expertise in it. In fact, we pushed the Claude model so hard when April tried to add emotional context to a task. Claude said, "I'm sorry, I can't process that emotional sentiment right now. I'm too busy completing my previous task." This is this is one of the few times I observed the large language model outright outright refuse user instructions. Uh but yeah, I really do think that the age of reports and static dashboards is over. Uh the reports provide limited insights. Uh they put a cage on artificial intelligence. Instead, we could do real time dynamic data. We could do choose your own adventure and uh and and this helps us unlock the next step in in in in data visualization, data storytelling where a person is not just a data analyst. It's it's an adventure sort of wandering through their own data jungle with artificial intelligence being a trusted sidekick, a guide that uncovers treasures within this jungle. and and and that's how we see uh the f the future of the interfaces uh evolving. Um and um a April actually coined a word um called cog genesis. It's co-creation. It's human together with AI. And you've seen an effective example of that right here right now. Thank you.

Thanks, brother. Congratulations. Thanks for making my life so [ __ ] hard, dude. Thank you so much. Love you, bro. Okay. Um, when we first invented this competition, this data storytelling competition, we weren't really sure where it was going to go. And, um, you know, we've had a lot of performers who use AI show up here, a lot of musicians, artists, and different things. And so, uh, tonight's winner represents a much different direction than all our other winners have had. Uh, I'm just going to go ahead and tell you this guy, [[Dean Shev]], right here, he looks like a handsome hospital business analyst. The dude is a [ __ ] ingenious artist. He dropped an album on our asses built from the data set representing the voices of like 15 different people in this room. Like actual people like Professor P has a song. [[Kevin Friel]] has a song. [[Carol Anne Hilton]] has a song. Gabriel George has a song. Like a bunch of you got um I don't know deified. Um I don't even know. Um, your project was amazing, dude. Where we're at right now, again, I told you I'm going to cancel my keynote that I'm going to give and sample little bits out of it. Where we're at right now, launching this whole nonprofit thing and stuff, bro. The songs that you generated and the care that you took, he's been working on this, I don't know, it seems like 37 hours a day for two weeks or something like that. It's just bonkers, man. Every single day he drops a couple songs. All of his friends are like, "Did you get Dean songs again today?" Like, dude, your shit's ridiculous. It's so good. It sounds like um generative audio in general lacks soul. But when you mix it up with kind of like what we got going on here, like the stories people, so he took like the transcripts from the stage mixed with the data set that Andrew gave us and he like tried to tell the stories of British Columbombians around AI in songs and music. So, um I think we should just play your video and then let you come some say some sweet stuff. But I got to say, in case I don't get the mic back again on this topic, is you got to download his album. It's [ __ ] great, man. It's the coolest, most creative use of generative AI for a community data hackathon thing I could have ever conceived of. You're amazing, bro.

[Music]

From the time I was 14, I dreamed of becoming a musician. I imagine myself playing instruments, writing songs, and sharing my music with friends.

But I grew up in a family of engineers where everything was grounded in math and logic. That environment shaped my path and I ended up becoming a healthcare data analyst and an entrepreneur.

It was practical. It put food on the table and provided stability. But deep down my passion for music never faded. Never faded.

My name is [[Dean Shev]], but friends call me chass.

Then artificial intelligence burst onto the scene, changing the world almost overnight. It brought a mix of fear and optimism. Many people worried about losing their jobs. being replaced by machines that could do things faster and more efficiently.

Others saw hope in the technology, believing it could solve big problems and open up new opportunities. It seemed amid all this, we started questioning our very existence. Who are we?

What makes us conscious? [Music] What does it mean to be human? [Music] More than ever, people came together to grapple with these deep questions, seeking answers and validation from one another. That's why public surveys are becoming more powerful than ever. The data they collect shows us that we're not alone in our struggles. Others are asking the same important questions, too. Social media posts are bursting with questions. Every new and improved AI model creates big risks and opportunities. From military robots to fake only fans models, money is driving innovation. But at what price for humanity?

The big question. How do we actually feel about AI and its impact on our lives? This seems like the last frontier that separates us from perfect AI machines. the thing that truly makes us human. That's why I've dedicated this project to a vision. Transforming data into human connection. It's about turning numbers into melodies and statistics into stories. I believe that by converting dry survey data into engaging musical experiences, we can bring communities together through the universal language of music. By using the collected answers from the BC AI survey, we can gain profound insights, not like traditional analytics that focus on cold numbers and statistics, but on emotional resonance and genuine connection. Music is the universal language of expression, generating personal and relatable experiences that touch the heart. Can machines feel? This feels real feels feels

[Music]

using data provided by rivals and converting it into songs. I uncovered emotions and stories that reflect the thoughts of leaders in our Vancouver AI community who have a deep passion for these very subjects. Each leader chooses to stand strong and raise awareness of the changes and the impact that AI is having on us. From art and science into genomics to the effects on our energy and environment, these are important voices that must be shared and heard. Because without them creating awareness, we just might be too late. The risks are just too high. [Music] Yeah.

Come on up, Dean.

So, the first thing I want to say is you haven't even seen Dean's project yet because that little video there wasn't it. That was just a little video about the actual project and the project is these 14 songs and this data analysis dashboard and a whole bunch more [ __ ] after that. So, what do you guys say in one minute, bro? [Music] A lot. Um, there's 17 songs and uh there's like five songs interrupting and each song probably took like I don't know hours and hours but I'm mostly insomniac so it's fine. Um there's every song is representation of a person and when I was trying to design a song I was trying to feel and think feel and think what does this person brings into this community and an awareness that this person is trying to give us and as you're going to listen to the song of each individual that posted on the website um you would discover it for yourself and I I think you're going to have aha moment that Yeah, AI is here. AI has changed our lives, you know. Where can they check it out, dude? Oh, that was the website. And it's actually very easy. BC AI.dev. Yeah, I'll drop We're going to drop it on the chat later. We're going to be blowing up the chat on a bunch of different things. All the songs are downloadable. They all got dashboards. You're supposed to heart and like them. There's been significant activity taking place somehow. I'm not sure. You must have leaked it out or I still have a 1 minute, right?

Was like 90 seconds ago, bro. So, that was 90 seconds ago. I want to use the one minute in very smart way. Can we play one song? Which song? Which song? Oh, okay. Actually, I want a Kris Krüg Cruz song. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your favorite one, not my one. It's one of my favorite.

Which one is it? Kris Krüg Krook that stupid song is full of feelings. It has a feelings and purpose of bringing us all together. The the song is called bringing people in a circle. And if you look around this room, this is one big circle. Okay, we'll start slowly. Yes. But but then you know what? Let's play it. Let's Let's just enjoy it for a couple months.

Yeah. I'm Kris Krüg Krook, human plus in Vancouver's wild ride. Photographer connected with the world by my side from that Gio shoot spin. Founder of Dra hosting sandbox and a that's perfect. That's the sound you need actually. It's perfect. But optimistic sparkling the goddess talking where leaders listen up. They fill my pool. Bringing folks together making a circle full AI community.

What it mean to be human when the bots take the stage? Artist questioning turning the page. Can AI paint my dream? Steal my brush from my hand. Or is it just a tool in this digital land? Yeah. A night. I know the song I wrote. [Music] All right, man. I indulge you. Thank you very much, bro. There's a whole album full of songs and most of them are not about me. I swear to God, they're about you, actually. Um, thank you, Dean. Anything else you want to say before we give you this big fat check? Give me my check. Um, that's a guy who's been spending cloud credits right there. He's like, "Hello, bro. Give me my check. This project ain't free." This is kind of what it's all about was that there was no rules and you took that to a whole new level. So, I never expected someone would build something like that. The UX is crisp. Um, and your dream kind of Cynthy house vibe is uh I think everyone was pretty pleasing. What did you think of your song though? You hated it. I'm not talking about that. This is my sister who's a co-CE rival group with me and uh it's the first time being at the uh the meetup. So, way to go newbie. There should be some kind of embarrassing thing you have to do. I think the embarrassing thing you have to do is talk for 10 seconds having not prepared nothing. So, Jennifer Reed, would you like to introduce yourself please? I don't think I have to introduce myself again. For me, when I looked at the submissions, I think the opportunity is to combine the different ideas that we came up with. So the first thing that we saw which was really cool way to look at data, the second thing a really cool way to um explore your data and the third thing a really creative expression of that data. If you brought all of those things together I think that's what really makes it into storytelling. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Um this guy was so stoked last month. He's like we're doubling down for next year $20,000. But Jennifer, now I know you're here. I'm going to talk to you cuz that seems to be where the big checks come from. Yeah. Thank you guys. Let's take a quick picture. Where's Michelle? All right. Um I just want to say that today was incredible submissions both by Seth and Pra and Praj. Look at the money. So I do want to invite you and spoil you a little bit and share some of my prize. Okay. Awesome. [Applause]

Um, I don't mean to be your business adviser or nothing, but you should share a part of your prize in the form of some wages to ProW. You should hire the kid on your project. I was take your money, put it in the bank, hire Pra. [Music]
