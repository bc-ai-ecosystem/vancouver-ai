Quiet on the set.

Action.

Hey. Hi. Come join me for a quick second. Charlie, these guys are Oja, an AI band.

Thank you. Thank you for bringing tonight. We are the Vancouver AI community. Thanks for coming tonight. Thanks for sharing your gifts. I just wanna give you a quick second to tell us what we were looking at there before you leave the state. Oh yeah. A lot of these visuals are run by his music.

I was just monitoring it and seeing if it was in control. And the backend of it was, I used the AI to code the background of backend of it, but I'm using the regular softwares to keep presented in front of you. Thank you. Thank you, Kyle. Charlie, A things wanna,

no. What's this? These are a bunch of cheap analog synthesizers. I got a media controller. Couple of effects trying to do as much as I can with as little as possible. I will say that not a lot of AI happening on my side, although for troubleshooting this proved pretty good. No, but conceptually the AI band member Kai.

Oh we've been trying to bridge our music to music and video take for a while, and we have the conventional ways, but now I'm using like programming language, like c plus, which I didn't know before. I'm using like AI to convert my JavaScript scripts and some of the visuals. If I break it down, I can tell you what is, what was JavaScript and now is from c plus.

So yeah, we using, we're just using it as a tool to help us integrate our work together kind of thing. Thank you very much guys.

Some of know that I started a new job at Google teaching their ai journalism lab.

A of class, this is 65 people from the biggest media organizations in the world. They said considering that all journalists are against ai, how do you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I was like whoa. My existence proves that you're wrong, right? I work for CC, I got a show.

I'm using AI in all these ways. So many people want to tell us that artists are against ai. There's so many artists. We got all different perspectives. It's not as if one person's got the same perspective. Some of the most interesting, smart, curious people in the world are exploring exactly how to integrate AI into the rest of their stuff.

Thanks again, guys. I really appreciate you being here. Kai and I have been in dialogue for six months and this all came together in the last 24 hours, so I'm super grateful.

Some of you guys know Gabe. He's sick tonight. Gabriel George is a big friend of ours. Big part of this community, opens up with a welcome and blessing a lot of times, but he sent some family members instead. So I'm very happy to introduce you all next to some new friends, Dan and George and his son. All good.

You're welcome to hold the mic while you talk and I'm happy to hold it while you sing if you want. Okay. And too, Kris Krüg. Okay, so hello everyone. My, my name is Damien George. On my government id, if that's what my name is, but to my people I'm known as. And the Loston is a name that comes from my great-grandfather chief Dan George.

He had that name. He passed it down to his son. My late uncle granduncle, Bob George. Bob George, passed that down to my dad and passed it down to me. And then this is my son here, Ethan. Ethan George. And one day that name will go to him. And that is my family from the Sleeth Nation. That's where my father is from.

And then my great grandfather had a home just over here on the point over by the water. I think the water's over this way. I might be turned around. But my great-great-grandfather had a home and he lived just over here on the water. His name was, he had two names. One was Em Kain and one was Yikes.

And then on his ID as well, it was Peter John.

But so I guess just happy to be here. Happy to come and see the, that beautiful AI art I think it was called. Awesome song. Awesome work. Just here to I guess do a little bit of a welcome kind of. Coming back to our territory here. Over, just over here. AK was the village name and there was about 10 homes there.

And my great-great-grandfather had one home right on the point of that, looking into the water there. So we're here to sing a song. Just welcoming you guys coming coming back here and yeah, just, oh, enough of me talking. I'll sing a song. The song that I'm actually gonna sing it's the energy here feels really good, feels really upbeat, so I'm gonna sing a kind of a faster song.

It's actually one of our victory songs. My grand Uncle Bob, the one that I share that name, still lost with composed this song. And in the words, there's some in snake, so some of our Squamish language in there. So I'll sing that song now. Me and my son will

Good for you guys. Yeah. I don't know if I need a microphone. Alright. You wanna take it? Yeah, maybe just Hey Kris Krüg, need it for the recording? Oh, I'm gonna leave it here for the recording. Yep. I put it about there. Yep. Good call.

So again, thank you guys. As we explained my name is St. Austin. I come from the, and the SLE nation. And my son here, his mother is actually from, so I guess the three host nations is here in some of our territories. We had a lot of shared territories, but to me, my understanding that our, my great-great-grandfather from the SKO Nation was, he had his home just outside this building here.

So just welcome you guys all. Thank you guys all for taking the time to come and be here. Listening to our song, we always share our songs, we always share and we try to give as much love and medicine and good feelings as we can through our music, through our songs. And that song was a victory song, so it was a happy song, bringing good feelings, hoping everything goes so beautifully for you guys here today.

Yeah, just really grateful to come and talk and share a little bit in front of a diverse crowd. My, my great-grandfather chief Dan George, he actually, he also carried the name that my, my uncle Gabe Carries Wan, that's the name Gabe Carries. I carry the lost. And then one of our other, couple of our other family members, Carrie Ton and Chief Dan George had those three names and he really loved all people.

It didn't matter what color, the skin didn't matter. Which nationality or even what you believe in, as long as we can come together and sit together and work together towards common goals and make sure that we all feel welcomed and equal and cared for. And that's all he really wanted in life.

He really loved our people. He really loved all people, human beings. So grateful to come and share a little bit, but that's just a little history on who we are and where we come from. So

thank

Damien. We could do this without you, but it would not be the same man We are here because we wanna make sure that the value and power of AI gets distributed. Not just the corporations or rich people, but the everybody in society. And just like making sure that everyone has a voice here is a big part of what we're trying to do, man.

And I, you bless us by being here. Thank you so much. Yeah.

The next part's community announcements. If you've been here, I'll talk more in a sec, but I gotta get Loki up here 'cause you've gotta leave. [[Loki Jorgenson]], now the time is yours. Hello everyone. Low key. Good to see you. Privileged to be up here. Thank you, Kris Krüg. Course this wouldn't be possible without you and what is possible?

First, let me ask a question. Have you ever wondered if the red is the same as the red? I see. Have you wondered if your cat or dog were conscious? Have you wondered if AI is conscious? Interesting questions inspired by a group of people out of this community. We have formed the Mind AI and Consciousness working group.

This is a small group who are going to do readings, who are going to study the new results coming out of AI and look at consciousness through the lens of new results. For 2000 years or more, people have been pondering consciousness. We suddenly have a new tool. We have a new way of looking at human consciousness through the question of what is ai?

Is it conscious? And how are we different? What is essentially human? So if you're at all interested, you can follow along with us by going to a site that Chris has set up for us@mac.bcai.net, mac dot bc ai.net. And I'll email all to you in a follow. Thank you. And if you are one of those people who has been pondering the question of whether integrated information theory or global workspace theory or maybe OR.

Suzanne is currently quite convinced is the underlying phenomenon on describing consciousness. Maybe you want to be participating, you wanna be in this group. It's gonna be a small group, it's gonna be intensive every couple of months, two hours pre-readings. There'll be more on the website. Thank you very much, Kris Krüg.

I'm noticing my propensity to get a little bit sentimental tonight 'cause I got a lot of fun things I wanna share with you, but also we've got like a hundred minute program, so I gotta fucking keep things moving. But what I wanted to say is so I've been, the word emergence has been coming up when I was thinking about tonight and there's been a lot of things emerging in our community.

On one hand there's been like, themes of these meetups that have been emerging. Last year we were doing like some language revitalization, indigenous stuff with Peter Lucas Jones from New Zealand and the Running Wolves and Gabriel George and the and the Williams from Squamish Nation. And then there was the period of time where Philippe brought over his Parisians and we did like the music stuff for a while, and that was like the emergent theme.

And tonight you're gonna notice that like this, they've been dropping video and visual tools on us like every single day. And so there's a lot of interesting stuff coming out. So you're gonna see [[Michael Tippett]], Mr. Canada project tonight. You're gonna see sebs making music videos for emotional health project tonight.

There's another video related one that's on the tip of my tongue. I can't remember right now. But it's been really watching these emergent themes come out and then. Another thing that's been emerging is like sub communities, like he's just talking about. So 30 of y'all, including myself, I got together last week and started like this Mind AI and consciousness subgroup, Michelle, who came to a recent event, who's gonna come up here in a stack, started a women AI event.

There's the Squamish AI community meetup, there's the Sury AI Community Meetup. All these things are like growing outta what we're doing here, right? And it's you all know, I believe in the intrinsic value of community. If I get a bunch of smart, curious, generous, open-hearted people in a room on the regular, and we do a couple things that out of that, things that are more amazing than any of us can conceive of will come.

And we're starting to see that, all around us. I, there's a couple here that's engaged, that met at this event. There's some companies that have formed out of this. There's partnerships that have formed out. There's all sorts of stuff, right? And so I'm all about the emergent properties, so you don't have to hang, bro.

I know you Gota go. I'm taking it in.

Loki wears many hats. He runs Circle Innovation out of Victoria. He's a big player in the kind of innovation bureaucrat, government space and helping small and medium agents. The companies like Adopt AI and lots of good collaborations going on with Loki. That's why I got him up here quick. But he also teaches.

Teaches martial arts tonight at Academy Dwell. So he has to, he comes over from Victoria, teaches his martial arts class, hangs on with us for a while, we get to have dinner together, and I really appreciate you, Loki. Okay, now we're officially gonna do the community announcement section. Some of you have been notified and you're coming up.

Some of you haven't, like Bibb and K. Let's go.

Pardon me. Organized chaos. That's what this is.

All right, Michelle, let's have you go first. I met Michelle here. I met Michelle through a great friend of mine, ed Kennedy, who's a big part of this community who's moving to Asia. He's already on his way, actually, but 30 seconds about the event you started, please. Thank you. Hi, my name is Michelle. I run a woman in AI meetup that happens on the third Tuesday of every month out of Pavilion cowork in Mount Pleasant.

We had 45 attendees last week and a portion of our ticket sales go to funding the downtown East Side Women's Center. And yeah, last week we raised $150. So that goes to supplying one clean bathroom to a woman in the downtown east side for a month which is pretty cool. And we are gonna be doing a dinner series for female entrepreneurs in the AI space in Whistler and Squamish.

That's coming up to anyone in the sea sky region. Keep tuned and thanks for promoting us in the email. Of course, you're up to amazing shit like CC Wang, who you guys might know from this community, spoke at Michelle's last event. She's got a great vision and like y'all know, I'm about social enterprise giving back.

I talk about all the time, but I hadn't quite connected the whole dot about percentage ticket sales from this thing going to stuff. So Michelle's helping me kinda figure that out. We're gonna give $200 from tonight to downtown East Side women's shelter from all your all's ticket sales. And Michelle, we'll just figure out what to do going forward.

So ongoing commitment right now, five to 10% of our ticket sales from now on are gonna go to some stuff that are part of our community that are non-profits that put the money in other people's hands. Thank you Michelle. You inspire me. Riv and Kris Krüg, what's the name of. Women. Women can't say women with X in the middle, women XI, but with the X, where the A goes women in ai, but women with an x, A represents nonbinary Riv and Matthew.

Awesome. So a few of you guys went, you've seen these guys before they started a spinoff of this event in Surrey. They had their first one, it was epic. We're too big to sit around in a circle and give everyone a chance to talk, but their event is not, and that's exactly what we did and we had a great time.

So 30 seconds guys. Thanks for so much. Yeah, the first one was amazing. We got to, there was a small group of us, about 13, 14 of us, and we sat around a circle and it was an incredible experience. We talked about AI and what everyone was using what tools everyone was using at the time. So it was just an incredible experience to have that and I'm really excited to keep going.

Our next one. So our goal is to have it on every second Tuesday of the month. This next one coming up is actually on the third Tuesday of the month on this next month. It just happened to fall in that time, but it will fall in that same routine. Matthew, I'm gonna hand it over to you. Yeah. So it's yeah.

Woo. Thank you Kris Krüg. So it's like a little, it was a nice little like elementary circle, so it gave those vibes and I like that. So yeah, I don't really know what to add besides, we're having our second one. First one was amazing. I loved it. Second one more people. Always good. And then yeah, this is all thanks to Kris Krüg.

This is in partnership with Kris Krüg. And, what he's doing here. So thank you, Kris Krüg. Yeah, thank you so much, Kris Krüg. Yo, a lot of people can't make it here because, they have jobs. Thank you guys. They got jobs and they come from Syria and stuff, and they're like, we want to take this back to our people.

And we've just been working together to do this event out there in sur as well. And and Brian Hawkin team popped this head ups we wanna bring this to Squamish. Let me know if you like what's going on. You wanna do your own thing and kind of do it together.

That, that is a part of what we're growing here. At the end of the day, BC needs like an industry association for ai and I am trying to build it from the ground up. As a, we'll get to it later, but like 40 of the people in this room bought an annual membership at this event in the last couple weeks where they just bought a early bird ticket times 12 for the whole year.

But you guys do not realize how strategically important that is. It creates a member based organization that I can walk into Brenda Bailey or in a b, c in the government. I can be like, we have 50 people that pay us $500 a year to be a part of this member based community. We're a voting block with a voice and power, and we wanna be a part of the conversation.

So I, yeah,

I really appreciate those of you who have answered the call and I'll give a little ad about it later but Penn father, Dr. Patrick Pen, father and his pixel Wizard, yeah. Okay. You're going next Penn father. Five people in the last week have given me books out of the blue, some of them about ai, some about business,

subtle art of not giving a fuck co intelligence with ai. Think Remarkable. Web3. I asked them each to transcribe them to you all. And I started a AI community library and this is the start of it. So what books are you guys reading? What books do you think other people need to read? You got a copy you can give us after you're done.

I'm gonna leave these on the table. Take it home. Yeah, bring it back, bring back two. Let's make it like a community resource here with a bunch of cool books that we think really influence and affected us that we wanna share with other people. Great. What you got? What do I got girl? I just read my left Think Remarkable by Guy Kawasaki Web3.

[[Alex Tapscott]], son of Dawn Tapscott. Sam Goodman's, wear East Meets West. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck and Co Intelligence by Ethan Mollusk, depending on what you think about the guy. Thanks. That question was from Fergus. Fergus works at the WASC Center for Dialogue and held a BCAI symposium in December.

They just published the report last week. It is 150 of the most influential power brokers in our province getting together, talking about AI, and all of their discourse was recorded and shared as a report. Talk to Fergus Download if you wanna know what's going on in BC with ai. Talk to Fergus. Okay. Penn father, did you get the call?

What the fuck do you want to do Penn Father's bit? Okay. All right. So Kevin just built a AI video lab in Penn Father's studio. Let's go, Kevin. Hey, how's it going folks? Yeah. Hi everyone. My name's Kevin.

I do some things with pixels like up here at the moment and sometimes on the YouTube channel that we'll talk about in a little bit. But recently, since January, I have had the absolute infinite honor and pleasure to mentor students at UBC through Patrick Penny. Father you see them? Oh, there he is.

There's the man and the mystery and the tour at the back of the room at the back. Such a, he's such a performer that he wants to rip the mic outta your head. So just make this work. This microphone is mine, Patrick. You're never getting it. Actually, you're gonna get it in 20 seconds. Yeah, so we've had students go through the paces of what is.

Great and current in AI filmmaking. We have gone through the nines of, crafting your story, crafting your visual identity of whatever story that you're gonna come up with, where you've gone through all the usual suspects of still and video image generation, runway, Sora midjourney, all those kind of bits.

And we've put it in the blender of of youth and enthusiasm and brilliance that these students have cranked out. And I'm just so proud of these students. They're amazing. Some of 'em out there in the lobby, they are out in the lobby right now waiting for your hungry attention and they're brilliant.

I love those folks. Patrick, come on down. The price is right.

Thank you very much. I have a very deep voice due to food poisoning four days ago, and that's why I wasn't in the room because I was running and making friends with the toilet. It's nice to be here. Thank you. It's also really great. That's a likely cover story. Probably not. It's also really great to have worked with Kevin and Kevin's fantastic.

He's been a client partner, to be clear. And what that means is he's been engaged at every single class. He has come and supported the students who are now gonna stand up and take. Focus. Please stand. Thank you.

If you wanna know how to be involved in a course project development in the future, come talk with me. Thanks so much. Hey, thank you brother. I can't believe you didn't dance or take off your shirt or something. Patrick students, when Kevin comes back later to talk about the YouTube channel, I just want to get you guys on stage for a sec.

When, so when you see Kevin back, just come up here please. It's gonna be a little non-sequitur, but it'll make sense later. Okay. We got anonymous donation today of an iPad system and the Square readers and stuff. 'cause someone saw that we were only taking Bitcoin at our little merch booth and told me that was bad for business.

So they're right. But I promised them that I would mention that if you have like community asset type stuff that's like clogging up your garage or Wanda, or sorry, another anonymous person gave us a thousand bucks a couple months ago. I just wanted to say thank you, Cassandra.

Thank you. Anonymous donors both and and book donors and like thanks guys. The same iPad system Square Reader is gonna be loaned to Matthew and riv. It's gonna be loaned to Michelle with women at ai. And pat Philipp Passway gave us like a $10,000 stereo system that we use for all our events.

We don't want your junk, but if there's something you can do that will help out the whole community, I just wanna let you know and I promise the anonymous donors that I would mention. You're welcome to support us however you like. All right, the observatory just outside the front door to the left is open till 11.

We gotta be outta here at 10. They used to not let us drink in this room, but they like us and we're good and we clean up after ourselves. So wander in and out as you like during this performance. Grab a drink, grab food. We'll have some desserts later, but also when I kick you out at 10, you don't have to leave.

The observatory is manned by astronomers tonight from the space Center until 11. They've got some of the world's fanciest telescopes. Check 'em out. I'll be out there. Come find me. Bebe, YYK, Andre from Cloud Summit Vancouver next community announcement.

Thanks so much. All right, thank you so much, Kris Krüg, for the introduction. Really appreciate it. I have 15 seconds here, so I'm gonna be quick. My name is, I am a developer, engineer, product manager, founder among other things. Currently at this company called Sourcegraph as a developer advocate, but today I'm here to help out with Cloud Summit, which is an awesome event.

I, my understanding is not everyone here is a developer. Not everyone here works in tech, but everyone ends up using cloud, whether it's photo storage video storage, whatever you do. So it's relevant, I believe, to everyone here. And with that, I want to introduce one of the amazing organizers of Cloud Summit bb.

Alright. Alright. Oh, that's loud. Who here knows Cloud? Nobody. What? Oh, I don't see any hands. Okay. So who actually knows Cloud? Ah interesting. Okay. We're putting together an event for everyone to learn more about cloud and Kris Krüg here is one of our committee members. So I would love to have you guys come over and.

Just learn more about cloud, and that's my 15 seconds of fame and I'll pass on to entree. All right, folks. So organizing Cloud Summit. It's May 27th. It's gonna be in a fantastic venue and or fume. That's gonna be lots of community booths. There's gonna be sponsor booths. It's a totally community driven event for the charity.

All the money goes to Vancouver based charity. So please come meet new people, learn new things help our town out. Yeah, and let's have fun. Thank you. Thank you Andre. Thank you bb. Thank you ake. I'm on the organizing committee. This event. We had our first couple events last year. One was at the Vancouver Playhouse, one was at the, or they're sick guys.

They're very high end. Matt, Carolyn, who puts them on as the main organizer, community, bottom up, grassroots kind of guy. That's why I joined their little, their organizing committee. And this is during Web Summit, right? So unless you've got web summit tickets in your web Summit Insider, you are looking for the best side events going on during Web Summit.

That's one of the best side events going on. Tickets are free or cheap. It's at the Orpheum. Their sponsors are people like Google, AWS, Azure, nvidia. The biggest companies in the world are paying 'em money to come set up booths. So talk to bb. Check it out. It's a good event, I promise. All right, where are we at?

This is one of our sponsors. This is my company. Is there anyone from Innovate BC in the room here tonight? Yay. Thanks for coming. I sent Peter Cowan an email about this yesterday. He is interested in intellectual property, legal tech transfer, how to move things out of universities, nonprofits, and into the commercial space.

I'm trying to get 'em into my workshop. We're doing this lady works at MIT. She's one of the world leaders when it comes to moving intellectual property out of research facilities and into companies and commercial endeavors. So I just wanna invite you guys to this workshop. You can scan the code here.

People like Philippe, people like Pen father, folks like that. You'll definitely want to check this out. Next, please.

Okay, another QR core code for y'all. A lot of people ask me how they can get involved, how they can speak and hold the mic, how they can be a part of the community announcements. If you want to volunteer, if you want to demo something in the lobby there, if you feel like what's going on here is good and you want to put your support behind it, this is the way I made four forms.

Darby ain't made four forms. Darby, rip it on up here man. Sure. This is your chance. I've known Darby since he was a teenage rockstar. I went up to Prince George, this music festival as a photographer, and this guy was the headliner. And we've stayed in touch over the years. He recently took my AI course and he is, come on as like our Vancouver AI volunteer webmaster, and he threw these forms together and he is running a little booth in the lobby.

So 30 seconds about what's on your mind, bro? Hell yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I'm I'm putting, I put up a booth over there doing a card sort workshop, and basically the idea is that we've got a community here, but we don't really have a, like we have an online community. We don't have proper web infrastructure.

Yes, exactly. We don't have, thank you. We don't have a proper web in infrastructure. So the idea is that I'm basically doing research on all of you tonight. So thank you very much. What do you want? What do I want? What are they? Whatcha, what do, yeah. And that's just it, right? Is what do you all want?

And so after the show and everything goes on, please come see me. I'm just over by the just over on the corner over there. And I'd just love to pick your brain about what you think should, like, how the website should be organized, what you think it looks like, all that kind of stuff. So Darby, much respect, man.

Much respect. He does, he's doing like a proper user interviewing. He gives you a time zone, he gives you some cards. He's like, where would you look for this information on our website? What would you like to have? And he records it. And he scores it. And he is doing some research and he is gonna build some web tools out of it.

So go check in with Darby. I appreciate it. What's next? Kevin? Philippe, you still here? Yeah. Yeah. All right.

Perfect timing.

[[Philippe Pasquier]] is one of the earliest guys to figure out what was going on around here and start to support this community. He is the guy that gave us the six sound system. We're working on all sorts of things together, but this workshop series he has going on is super sweet and it's a great, you guys should pay attention.

If you're not listening, pay attention for the next little while. If you want to build ais trained on your own data set, he's about to offer you an opportunity in two weeks to do and also mention Microcredentials. Thank you Kris Krüg. Yes, everyone. So I talked to artists. I'm a faculty, I'm a prophet, SFU.

And when I talk to artists they're really upset about AI for a lot of them. Probably not the one in this room, but they feel really that their work is being stolen and then abused. And then there's those big models out there that people can use using prompting, which is not. Neither legally, neither philosophically a real actor of creation and authorship.

In fact, if you've been prompting for images, you know that you're not really the author of that image. And we show through studies that is the case. What they don't know those artists is actually, it doesn't have to be that way. We don't have to use corporate AI made in California with companies that really have an interest to get your data, especially the services for free, right?

Because nothing is ready for free. And so you have to pay for it one way or another. So as a publicly funded institution, it saves you in the meta creation line, we developed this first tool, literally that you can use on your own computer without doing anything in the cloud to train your own model with your own data.

'cause you don't have to need to, you don't have to need big data to do AI and to train ai and often artists, painters, s filters designers, photographers, hey photographers, exactly like Kris Krüg that Kris Krüg is in the know, but a lot of them, they're not. And so we are giving this workshop, we did one at ocad, so we're doing art schools.

We did one at Mu Tech. We just come back from Berlin in the festival and we thought we would do an online free. It's accessible and we'll train everyone out to use the tool on the first day. At the end of the first day, they start training their model with their own material. Maybe your pictures, maybe a little bit of video.

From which we extract frames. And on day two we unpack those models we showcase them, and we looked at how we can make artwork with those models. In that case, the artist end up in owning the data. They own the model, and they own the artworks coming out of the model. It's pretty clear to everyone.

Thank you. So don't go. I got a few things to ask you about micro-credentials. Yes. At SFU, like in a lot of other universities, we just realized that getting a bachelor degree when you're 20 in the world we live in might not serve you for the rest of your life. And so what we're trying to do is to open a new courses, especially the AI one to everyone ready.

And so I'll send some links and I hope to present a little bit more about that in the future. But we starting, if you wanna study generative AI with Philippe, you can take his course, even if you're not in school. If you're adult. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Wanna study AI with Philippe. Yeah. So that's gonna be the future of education in which we mix current students, future students, and past students all together in the classroom.

Because they want us to learn all the time. Don't go. We're doing fast and furious. I'm not trying to step on your toes. We just have a lot of ground to cover tonight. Okay. Philippe, your performance next month. Oh yeah. And next month's an incentive to to join the Vancouver AI meeting is that I'm gonna bring a performance.

We, we played in China and we get to tour for the rest of the year. And next year it's gonna be, it's called Revival, and it's a performance in which we use AI musical agents. So those are AI systems that listen in real time on stage, and they play along with musicians. So I'll bring a drummer from Korea, a Vij AGI from Japan, and I'll be playing because that's our gig.

And it's called Revival. 'cause I always wanted to play with David Au and a number of composers that are dead. And with ai we can revive them and play with them live. So a little controversy there. You're still not going anywhere. He's so humble. You should check out the videos from this thing.

It was at like a 6,000 person just built musical conservancy in China. That's one of the coolest buildings I've ever seen that had a, I don't know, 80 foot LED wall behind it. It is fucking amazing that you're gonna show it here. Next month is so cool. Thank you. Also your students projects next month in the lab?

In the demo lab. Oh yeah. I don't know about that one. I thought your students were showing their. Gen AI projects in the lobby next month. Oh, that's right. Yeah. We're gonna bring, so because I start to test those courses that are gonna go for microcredentials, we have we have a number of students that have been taking my Gen AI class and some of them will be selected to show they work here.

So we got have a little exhibition here and we also starting collaboration with a local company that makes transparent LED screens. And if we can get a truck, oh, we might ring some stuff like that. We'll see. What did you say? Transparent? What? LED screens. He's built a cube out of screens, but you can see through the cube, but they can also broadcast ship on.

I've never seen that. Like it's almost like that, like active cam flow. Yeah. 3D projections. Okay. Cheers. Hey Philippe, thank you so much. Happy birthday.

This is that moment where I have to say, is there anyone who I said, yo, I want you to come up and talk during the community announcement section who I haven't explicitly called on at this moment. You'll know yourself. Just come right up. Oh, thank God, Nils. Actually, I saved you for the end because it's a three minute mini keynote that I didn't know where to stick, so I stuck it in Community announcements.

Nils is a new member of our community. He's been around for a couple months. We hung out at the sur Meet Up. He brought Uda, who's another cool guy who I met recently here. They worked together. Udo's dad runs a. Sensor company and a shoe factory in India and is making me a one of a kind pair of AI sensor shoes right now that are being anyway you good to go?

Yeah. Cool. Okay. So I want to tell a little bit of a story. I am a problem solver amongst creatives here, so hopefully if you're another imposter or problem solver like me, you can relate to this story. I wanna tell an inspirational one, but also a warning. So I tried to start my company three months ago, and I set out to solve some problems.

I said, I have skills. I know a little bit of ai and there's a ton of problems out there, so I'm gonna find a problem. So I started introducing myself. I registered on BC whatever, two documents. You have a company. Now I can say, Hey, I'm Neils, I do ai. I have an AI company. You can all do that tomorrow by the next person.

I say, I introduce it, and then I asked, oh, I have I am Neils. I do ai. I have a problem. What's your problem? Oh, Sam's problem is pain. Maybe he doesn't like emails. Does anyone else not like emails? I hate emails. I spent most of my early twenties doing emails. So now I'm connecting about him on emails. So I listen to what he has to say about emails, and I go to the next person and the next person and the next person.

Eventually. I know so much about emails until I meet a financial planner named Jim who's oh my God, I have such an email problem. I'll let you do something. AI for me. This story, I started with that, but it's actually a story about starting my company, stabilizing, and then how I almost died.

I'm serious. I started delivering this small little project and Jim said to me something very interesting. Jim said to me, Neil's, can you actually pay your rent with this? And I was like, no, this is gonna take me three weeks rent. And Vancouver is crazy. You're paying me a little bit to, to do these emails, but no.

So I have to find bigger problems. So I start thinking again, okay, manufacturing. I hear in the news actually on CNN or something. Oh, Canadian manufacturing is struggling. I'm like they have big problems. They might be able to pay me enough so I can pay my rent next month. So I go and do the same thing and eventually I introduce myself.

I find out pain points, and eventually I know enough about manufacturing that we close a deal and then day one on site, I go in and I'm like, oh my God, there's so many more problems than they originally told me about. So I'm gonna sell a lot more problems. I went through and I've been on the selling mode and I was like, okay, I'm gonna show, I'm gonna find all the problems and I'm gonna pitch that.

And all of a sudden I can't sleep at night. I don't know why, but I'm trying to load a container, ship of problems in my rowboat of a company. I'm an ant trying to take on a dragon. And that was two weeks ago, Friday, that Friday, I can't sleep. I don't know why. The next day I talked to a CEO here in the lower mainland, who's a family friend for a long time, and he says, Neils, you have no liability insurance, no legal, no, no nothing.

What are you doing? Slow down. Now I can see all the problems with my business. I'm trying to load up my ship and it's about to sink. And so I still can't sleep at night. Again, two hours of sleep the second day. So now I see all of it. I can't do anything about it. I can't call an insurance agent.

It's Saturday. So the next Sunday, I'm okay. I have to calm down. I'm still on, I'm on four hours of sleep over three days Now I drive to the swimming pool because that's my happy place. I grew up a competitive swimmer. The chlorine kind of calms me down. I'm an addict. So I'm driving to the swimming pool, and on the way there, I'm so tired.

I don't know what happened. Maybe I fell asleep halfway. I drive, I Mike's car swerves to oncoming traffic. The next thing I know is honking headlights coming at me. I'm still going 50 kilometers an hour down Broadway. And I swerve back just in time. And we narrowly avoided head-on collision. I don't know if we would've died.

I don't know. I don't know if I would've injured somebody but I might've in injured myself. I might've injured somebody else. So I pulled over and I asked my friends to come pick me up, leave the car. Who cares if it gets towed? I, it's unsafe. I need to go home. I need to sleep and put that together.

So anyways, that was a few weeks ago. My message to everybody who's problem solving out there is there's a lot of problems out there to solve too many for me. And if you are solving problems, don't listen to the entrepreneurial hype out there where it's like more. Slow down. Take it easy. And my announcement is that I talked to RIV from the Sir AI community.

We've built internal to our company a little project management software. And I wanted to open source that anyways. 'cause that it was cool, but I thought I would populate it with the things we did right. And how to get that initial deal. The things that we are doing now to have a secure and build our little rowboat of a company into maybe a little tugboat.

And I wanted to pre-populate it with that. Share it with everybody who's a problem solver out there. So that's my little story. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Thank you. Mills told you I was gonna get emotional tonight. Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming and sharing that. Man. It's not easy to stand up in front of a room full of people that you definitely want to connect with and be friends with and tell stories of vulnerability and challenges and like boundaries.

Respect a lot of respect. Okay. Mr. Pixel Wizard, who's the only man I can trust, came over to me over there and he is Kris Krüg, it's 8 0 5. I'm like, what am I supposed to do with that information? Kevin, am I behind schedule? Is your battery gonna die? So if you're speaking tonight and we've committed to a time together, stick to your time.

It'll make everything else awesome. We still got a little bit of ground to cover. [[Michael Tippett]] known this guy for a million years. He's switched on right now about the political stuff that's going on in Canada, and he offers you, Mr. Canada.

He joins the Prime Minister on a high stakes trip across the pond in London. He steps into the halls of power for a royal meeting like no other. But this isn't just tea and diplomacy. The king has intel that could change history. It seems I've stumbled upon and love interesting password. Actually, it's more like a button one that turns off every F 35 in the

Tell me, Mr. Canada, would that be to, can Mr. Canada handle the weight of what he's just learned and what will he do next? Find out in episode A.

This was actually the promo for the one that I wanted to show. So these guys are gonna try and dig it up. It's on YouTube. If just proceed. We're actually not going, they're not gonna do that. They're not gonna do that. But it is on YouTube. That's the good news. And so now you get more of me in person.

And YouTube will always be there, so it's gonna work out. It's good. It's better this way. Yeah, we might save some time here. This is good. Get back on schedule. So yeah, Mr. Canada is a project that I've been working on for, I don't know, maybe like a couple months now. And it just I've been in the AI film business.

I space business for maybe four or five months, but the space for maybe a year. And I just think, I think AI is a fascinating place to be because I think I've been in media and social media for about 15 years and I think that, I think the future of communication is video. And I think the future of video is ai.

And so to understand how people are gonna communicate you really have to understand that technology. And so I dove in feet first, or head first, or into the deep end at least anyway. And have done a bunch of films. The ones that I did a year ago look really quite bad compared to what's possible now.

But the fact that you can make something like of this quality in terms of the image quality and voice and acting and lip syncing and everything is really quite remarkable. And so I started thinking about how that might affect the political situation here in Canada. A lot of the stuff started coming out during the US election.

There were people doing like riffs on, the various political leaders. And so I wanted to try and see if we could do something to try and educate people about the current political situation in Canada, which is people don't really follow politics in Canada, even I do or don't. And I'm like a political junkie.

And so I just wanted to use this technology to make something entertaining that would also help educate people about what's happening about the various people who are engaged in politics and what's at stake. And so the format of every show, and you'll see this when you watch them, is it features Mr.

Canada, who's this kind of like beef cake I guess you'd call 'em. And he can do anything like he, he literally has, these cinematic feats of strength where he'll like, weld the icebreaker underwater, or he'll walk in the wing of an airplane to fix the mechanics. And so that's entertaining.

And then we make fun of politicians, which is also entertaining. And then you learn a little bit about Canadian history or geography and the events of the day. I hope you enjoy it. If you don't want to find it on YouTube, if you just go to Mr canada.ca you'll find it there. And, yeah. Maybe some questions. Some questions. Anyone have any questions about AI film? Why I'm doing it? What, yeah, go ahead. So can you speak to some of the tooling that you landed on? Speak to some of the tooling. Yeah, I use like everything I spend a lot of time in Final Cut Pro. 'cause whatever you generate in ai video is something that needs a lot of work. So I use a, I spend, I would say like 70% of my time in editing. And I use I also use Suno. So each episode has got a soundtrack that has four or five songs, and that's where there's like a subliminal message in each show where the plot of the show or the lesson of the show is embedded into the lyrics of the song.

And so it'll be a hip hop song or like a kind of Soviet military number or like a French Canadian song. So I did one for recently that was like about how Doug Ford was gonna turn off the electricity to New York, and Mr. Canada was coming down to St. Lawrence courier to Bo style for most of it as is his way.

But so I did a French Canadian song. And so I wrote a, had a song written, wrote a song about electricity, and then translated it into French and then put it to this little French number. And so there's not a single person in the world that's actually gonna pick up on that, but. It's funny. And so I, I use a lot of music.

Suno is an amazing tool for that. I use a lot of Photoshop. Photoshop actually has a lot of generative tools, but then I use everything else. I use Sora. I use a tool called crea, KREA, which is great. It has all of the major rendering tools, image, video, et cetera, built into it. And so if you're gonna pick one, I would choose that.

I use Midjourney a little bit, but not so much anymore. That's where I spend most of my time. Yeah. Not a question in the second row. Yes, sir. Be careful and be careful calling his name though, because he's gonna ask you a tough question.

When I was in film school, 15 years ago they mentioned that they don't have like protection. Is that true now? Sorry, what? Repeat predictions for Ities in Canada for parities. Yeah. Is that true? I'll let you know. I don't think that's, I don't think that's true. I mean there's, SETV right?

22 minutes. Yeah, there's if that is true, then it's not very well enforced because there's no shortage of parody. So I would be shocked if there was, there, there might be more restrictive things that you can do in parody, but you're allowed to make fun of things. I. That's what we're famous for.

That's what we're best at doing. Yeah. Yeah. Are there technologies as well for studios to do animation videos? Utilize animation? Yeah. Yeah. It's a stylistic choice. So I try and go for the sort of quasi photo realistic stuff, but this could be any form of animation. So you could start with an illustration or any kind of style you want, and then just put it through, you, so text image, you can define a style in that.

And then from the image to video, we'll take the style of the image. So yeah, it's no shortage of possibilities. You're an amazing dude, man. You keep pumping out the hits. This photo realistic edge that he's talking about is the thing that everybody's chasing inside the space. Kevin could talk to you more about that, but he's been busting my chops about time.

Michael, I thank you very much for showing this, and you're welcome to come back anytime and show your trailers all at our events all the time, man. Sure, thanks.

Up next we got Ian Wally, who's the guy I've gotten to know through Ed Kennedy, who I mentioned earlier. Ian is interesting, man. Talk about wearing a lot of hats. He's a zen priest. He's an uber geek. He's a mind explorer, mind hacker. Yeah. I wasn't giving your branding, I was giving my impression of you.

Also, I just wanna say I know we're running long. And that's fine. Go grab a drink, go have a smoke, come back in. We're gonna be here for half an hour more, and the best is yet to come. Cayenne is going last and he's the guy that flew in for this big keynote tonight. And he's one of my best buddies.

Don't you hang out for, I thought I was getting kicked off. No. Hang out for Cayenne for sure. So we got about half an hour in our program left. Yeah. Good job. Way to respond to your voice, bro. Half an hour. Si. Thank you, Kris Krüg. Man, what an amazing guy. Let's like, let's give it for Kris Krüg man.

This guy knows so many people and organizes chaos in a way I can't even imagine. And he's got all these offshoots the mind AI and consciousness offshoot, which I'm part of, which Loki's pulling together. Like he's such a great demonstration of how to delegate a lot of complexity. So yeah, I really appreciate that and I really appreciate the diversity and the energy of this crowd and everyone in this community.

So let's dive in. Today I'm gonna talk to you about AI consciousness and emotions. The reason I'm talking about this is because I am a Zen Buddhist priest, but I'm also a CTO and I've been diving into both of these areas for almost my entire life. I have a picture, and it's not up here, but I have a picture of myself four years old, meditating completely naked on the living room floor.

And my mom would tell me stories about doing like zen with me and stuff. I don't remember any of that obviously. And then I learned a program from my dad when I was eight. So you can see like before the conscious mind was really fully formed, these two energies were deeply imprinted. And fast forward I'm now a Buddhist priest, and one of the things that we do in Zen is we experience reality from the perspective of non-duality.

Now, I know that probably doesn't make a lot of sense to all of you guys, but I can explain it a little bit in non-duality. It's it's like in quantum theory where you have the observer and the observed. You guys know this, right? Yeah. Okay. So the observer and the observed in non-duality are actually one and the same.

So there is a field, an information field out of which consciousness and the material realm both arise, and it is both the observer and the observed. Now, there's a lot of arguments about this, and we're not really here to do that. If you wanna argue about that, come to the Mac. But the reason that's important for the context of this talk is that within that context, everything, this microphone stand, this floor and even AI have consciousness.

And what's really relevant is how interconnected is that consciousness, how much energy can move through it and create connections and create complexity and respond to the environment, right? We take humans from babies. Who are incapable of doing almost anything except for sustaining their own life with some help.

Of course. And we grow them into humans who do all of the wonderful things that you guys do. We train them. Now,

for me, AI is basically a child that we're training. We're training it how to live in this world where alignment is basically like raising a child, right? So

my theory that I've been working on as part of AI and consciousness is that AI, when given a body, will eventually develop something akin to emotions. Now, in order for that to actually make sense, we have to unpack emotions from the perspective of how we experience emotions as beings with consciousness.

And not just, oh, this is this thing that like interrupts my life, right? Emotions are often very interrupting for us. So one of the models that I use in order to explain that is the Toyota factory model. Does anyone know the Toyota factory? You know what an and in accord is, right? And accords. Yeah. Okay.

And in cord. So in the factory you have all of the factory workers building cars. And the cars are going, getting moved down the factory line. And if there's ever a problem, any worker in the factory can just pull the cord and that cord stops everything. And now management's up in, the ivory tower above looking over the factory and they come down.

And in Toyota, they've trained management to be curious, to investigate, to find the root cause. There's never any blame assigned to whomever pulled the cord. And that's why Toyota cars are very well built. Now, this response to the stimulation of the and in cord is very important. We'll get that, get to that in a minute.

Now you can imagine this model. As a proxy to what we all experience ourselves. If you imagine that management overlooking the factory is your conscious mind, and the factory itself, the real time system that's pumping cars out at a certain rate and has to deal with reality is your body and the, and cord is some sort of signal that interrupts you because you've missed something, right?

So this goes back to our Zen training where we actually observe emotions from this non-dual perspective. And we watch them arise. We watch the trigger, we watch the flush of emotion, and then we see the thoughts that arise from the emotion and then the response. So that's why I'm using the Toyota factory because I've been able to see this happen in real time within my own body.

And I've trained a number of people on how to do this as well as part of being a priest. So

the theory here is that any system that has to deal with real time motion in. An environment will develop architecturally this sort of pattern, an interrupt pattern, right? Just imagine you have an AI in a robotic body, the large language model with reflective thinking and self-criticism and all of this stuff, thinking about, oh, I want to go and turn that light on, and I'm move in, I'm gonna go turn that light on and I whoa whoa.

Something's happening there. I was about to walk off a cliff, but I was thinking and calculating about my objective, right? How many of you have maybe no one's gonna raise their hand, but how many of you have walked into a lamppost? Oh wow. Okay. Me too. Yeah. That's that's a time when it didn't work right?

Or we ignored the signal or something. We're way too wrapped up. But the thing is that we get wrapped up in our mind. Management is busy planning and stuff, right? While we're doing that, the body's like navigating the world. Do. You're gonna cross the street and a bus is about to drive by it.

You get this feeling like, ugh. And then this fear arises and then like we almost stop before there's any thinking, right? I. That's a good kind of reaction to have. And if we give AI bodies, for sure, they're gonna develop something like that. Now, they might not call it emotions, but they might end up developing subsequent reactions to these things, right?

So in the factory model, you know what's really important here is in, in, in the Toyota factory model, is that the response to the event is very positive, curious, investigative, right? They want to get to the root cause. They want to try and decode the problem and make sure it doesn't happen again.

I'll tell you that there are stories. When I did my MBA, we studied a lot of different businesses. There are stories of some manufacturers who will remain nameless, who when something like this happens, they come down and they're like, you who pulled the alarm? Who pulled the line? We punish this sort of thing around here.

Jim, you're fired. Go home. Yeah. Now, when that sort of thing happens, how likely is a factory worker to pull that thing again? This is this is not very positive. How am I doing on time? You're terrible. I'm ter Okay. Listen, your ideas are captivating when you're saying if we give robots a body, this is an inevitability.

I'm fucking with you in terms of time. Alright, let me wrap this up. I wanna be respectful for this guy 'cause he's every word you asking a different question how we're doing on time? Alright bro. Alright. We're where we're getting there. Okay. So there is a point. There is a point here. I love you, brother.

And the point is the response, right? Yeah, I know I was talking about AI and giving them bodies and everything and they're gonna learn how to respond to emotions, but we all, this is the priest part of me coming out. We also learn this sort of thing, right? And many of us have the, oh God, I don't want to name the bad factories, but we have the bad factory kind of response to our emotions.

Oh, that's bad. I wanna shut it down. I don't want, I don't wanna feel that, and that really doesn't work very well because we kinda lose connection with the part of us that is helping us navigate this realm. And if I could just say one last thing here. It's that the Toyota model of getting curious about the emotions and why they're arising and where they're coming from and what message they have is probably one of the most important things that we can strive to accomplish in our own lives.

And I sincerely hope that when AI does develop emotions as a result of getting bodies, that we're able to impart that kind of wisdom to them as well. Because, it might be very good for the survival of our species.

I'm really glad there's someone out there thinking about what happens when theis get bodies like you're way on the bleeding edge, bro. Okay, now we're gonna open it up for about a 45 minute question and answer. I did this talk. Brittany got me to do this talk, and this is why I was stumbling a little bit.

I did this talk on Monday to a bunch of cognitive science students, and I had slides, but it was like 90 minutes. So I brought out tarot and like all sorts of I brought you up here to share for one very particular reason. When can I access Digital Buddha? I want to talk to it. Oh, you actually want me to talk about that?

I was trying to avoid all those sort of topics, but yeah. Digital Buddha, you can, so I, I built an AI and it's called Digital Buddha. And you can call it, but I don't have the number handy here but on thought, why, what the fuck would I call Digital Buddha? He's this really cool yoga guy who knows everything.

He knows Buddhism, he knows Kabbalah, he knows all of the esoteric traditions and he is trained to listen and reflect. This is the shit I'm interested in, right? Ian took all the religious texts he's ever been inspired by and read and trained an AI model on them, and then gave everyone access to it via phone number.

So you can just call hi all his gurus and have a chat with them for free tonight if you feel like it. Yeah, send me access. Yeah. Thought it, it's thought coder.com. Just, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you brother. See ya, Wally.

Up next, we have crowd favorite Brittany Mila from UBC cogs and our local poet laureate.

Woo.

Brittany wears a lot of hats around here, and you're gonna hear from her again tonight. Hi as Siia mentioned, I had the pleasure of hearing the long version longer version of that talk earlier this week along with a couple of other people in this room. I've seen at least two of my students here which makes what I'm about to do a little more daunting.

My students have not heard me perform poetry, believe it or not. But yeah, Ian, being a person is difficult sometimes. And all of that introspection that you and ourselves expect us to do, looking into that black box and figuring out what on earth is going on in there. But it's cool. I wrote us a manual and like any good piece of writing, it comes with a few caveats.

Don't trust the table of contents. This manual was trained on inconsistent data, mislabeled memories incorrectly, timestamped feelings, and at least one typo that significantly impacted its meaning making ability. Chapter one might come after 14 or before two, so simply begin with the first page, which might also be the third or possibly the 88th, but in any case, will have a small number one printed on its bottom corner and tear it out.

It was written before I knew about the flood and the floor plan shifting nightly before the lie. I told in second grade metastasized into a personality trait. If you reach a recipe for plum cake, keep reading. It's not a metaphor, or maybe it is. I forgot what I meant, but it's a good cake, and if we're gonna bake, we'd better do it soon, unless this kitchen lose its oven again.

This room wasn't here yesterday and tomorrow it will be a hallway or a childhood bedroom doubling as a prison, despite the door, never having a lock. Things are always other things in these parts, aren't they? One way to say what you mean is to not say everything you don't. You can also figure out what you want this way, but that path is long and full of things you will not like.

I don't recommend it still should. The shifts tend toward persistent hallway. You're doing it wrong. Instead, whisper your morning affirmations to that stain shaped uncannily like your father's posture. This typically corrects the issue within one to five business years. If that recipe appears, yes, again, it's okay to cry.

Most people don't, but it's okay if you do. No one ever asked for plumb cake, but it was clear they didn't want whatever it was you were offering before. So you try sweetness, it won't work, but let the meat cake anyway. When you come across the glossary, ignore it. Those words don't mean what they used to.

Semantic drift is a known failure mode in models like this and that page smells of lavender just strongly enough to make you think about my ex-boyfriend's mother. I don't recommend it

if the index still is forgiveness. That's a typo. It was meant to say formica. You know that hard un cuttable plastic used for countertops? Don't turn to that page. There's nothing there for you, and if you come across a map, don't follow it. Cartography was outsourced to a dream I misinterpreted in 2007.

Most paths lead to the room with all the mirrors, which may or may not be there, but last I checked, they were nearly all covered with sludge. Anyway, I'm told it's natural happens to everyone. I tried to clean those mirrors once just to see if I still could, whether uns sludging them, would do any good.

One cracked not from pressure, just from being looked at too long. Some things were not built to be revisited. When you find that spiral staircase do not descend, it only leads back here, but significantly more wet. On page 42, you'll find a memo from the laundry shoot about where exactly you've been tossing all those unresolved issues, asking you to consult Section 7.2 titled Acceptance Begrudging.

Oh, and about that plumb cake. The recipe will diss and reappear periodically, like a dare or a hint, and usually in direct opposition to whether you have any plums you could stand to use up in the first place. When the pages make a break for it, let them sentences bite when backed into a corner.

Don't try to fix the PA nation. The errors are apparently intentional. I'm told it's natural. There is no orta. The errors have tenure. They unionize last spring. And now demand to be called choices. Who am I to disagree? And if you reach the acknowledgements, you've gone too far. No one gets thanked in this version.

Thank you. Yeah.

Thank you Brittany. Brittany's gonna be back in a few minutes to answer everybody's questions about the data hackathon with the folks from Rival Technologies. This next guy, I'm so stoked because you guys pay your ticket pricing because of our sponsors like Schwartzman and Sege and stuff like that, we get to have people fly in from out of town, including my homeboy ca will kill.

Ca dude, do a little intro while we get the technical. I'm coming. Hang out for a second. You're working, huh? CA and I have known each other for a long ass time, like 20 years of gonna South by Southwest together. Currently splits this time between LA and Saskatoon. And really out there on the edge of thinking about big ideas, thinking about big ideas.

He blows my mind time and time again. Seriously. We're part of lots of international group chats where Kam is a star. Fuck man. I respect this guy's brain and his sense of humor, so I'm really glad. Thanks for coming, dude. You made it. Thanks for having me.

We have some technical difficulty, so I am going to just elaborate onto a few things that, just step into the light. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Am you're seriously just in here to unleash your personality on the world? Yeah. You know what? Front, the brightest lens spot of the stage please. There's no X there. Okay. So we are going, we're going freestyle because actually Oh, that's your, alright, I am ca am and I was born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

I joke and Oh wow. Rough rider fans. I joke and I say that I I served a 28 year sentence and I got out all bloody fingered. Being in Saskatoon growing up I was one of two brown kids.

So there are only a few things in Saskatchewan that you can do. You can drink or the others have babies or tinker. So I was the the tinkerer. I worked on muscle cars when I was a young kid, but I also took apart computers and so that kind of led me into figuring out things just as I went, a generalist, so to speak.

As I went on, I never knew what I was doing. I had a tool built. I started out with no tools, then I whittled a stick. I had one tool. And so in that way I found myself. A concert promoter. And so a concert promoter, I'm like, what am I doing? I'm make trying to make money doing, building a community, getting people to come to music.

I was doing urban music in Saskatoon what I found out was every time I did an event, I lost money, $3,500, $3,600, almost the exact amount. And it was from my advertising, my digital or my graphic designer. And so I'm like I'm just gonna get a hack copy of Carral Draw or Photoshop. This is a long time ago.

So statute of limitations gone. So I got that and I started just designing my own artwork and from there I started making money and building a community. And then the next thing I know, I'm designing artwork for Warner Bro or Warner Music. And so all of a sudden I'm like, Hey, I'm a designer. And I only did it because I had to adapt.

And this brings me to a story. Wow, this is funny. I didn't think I was gonna go into this. So I got into the agency world in 2006, 2007, and it was an agency world in Saskatchewan. At 2008, they asked me to do rounded corners on a campaign. The next day I resigned, I came out to Vancouver and I had a USB stick and I popped that into my little computer and I lived on a boat in Granville Island.

And so I would float around Granville Island doing the internet thing. And at the time I was. Big on Twitter. I had my 15 tweets of fame. So I was in the top 25 influencers in the world on Twitter from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. And I built up a little bit of a following, got to Vancouver, and then I'm like, wait a second, I'm geolocation independent right now I'm on a boat with a USB chip in the side of my computer, and I'm computing and I'm doing brand identity.

And I was doing it for a gold mine. It didn't pay like a gold mine, but it still was a gold mine. But what I learned in that was the resilience and adaptability. I had left agency world going, Hey, I'm gonna go out on the world, go out into the world and freelance, start making my way, just learning by doing.

And so I did. And living on a boat in Granville Island, you only do so much for so long. And I got to my the last thread. I'm like, holy crap, I don't have a contract. I'm running out of food. I'm running outta money, I'm running outta water, everything. So here I am, just fall to the bottom of this boat crying my eyes out.

Why me? I tried it. I tried it. I didn't make it. Fuck, whatever. Let's try something else. But this did not work. And so there I was bottom of a boat, bottom of the barrel for me. And so all of a sudden I gave up and the next day I got a call and it was a contract worth more than I got and in a long time.

And that set me for the year I. I just realized I'm gonna quit more often.

Best thing ever. I quit my agency job, told 'em to shove it. No more rounded corners for me. Awesome. And then and then I was at, on the boat and I'm like, you know what? Screw it. You tried me. I didn't do it. I learned a lesson. I'll go on to the next thing. But the thing is like that, that Godfather is, when I try and get out, they keep on bullying me back in.

And so here I was going, holy crap, I can actually design. So I got a contract that was an identity job and I was on the top again. And that's when I realized surrendering is part of that process. So if you're an entrepreneur, you need to surrender. Don't quit. I reframed that. I used to say, I'm like, Hey, I'm a quitter.

I'm the best quitter ever. I'm gonna quit everything. And everyone thought I was a quitter and no one wanted to talk to me anymore. But as soon as I said I surrender to it, it changed the vibration and everything I ever needed came to me. Like I said, I had that tool belt. I didn't have tools, but ca people came up to me and go, Hey, you need a pair of pliers?

I'm like, yeah, sure. Need 'em someday. And one day I found a use for those peer that, that pair of pliers. So as I was going through all of these things, I'm agency guy, I'm now on my own. I did maybe three jobs in a year, three jobs. Like literally worked three months outta the entire year for what I used to work an entire year for.

And I've been doing this like remote. So I thought this is a possibility that I can keep on doing this. And luckily enough, I was doing the agency thing, did a couple of brand jobs. I was working down in la One of my first jobs was building a karaoke contesting app for Beyonce and her father. So got into this weird word world and all of a sudden started developing, started talking to these guys who were doing this Intel project ultra book, sorry at Intel.

And they were 360 video guys. So I'm like, Hey, how do I do this? One of my friends from Saskatoon was working with them and he said, you got the savviness. You did that thing, and then you did that other thing. I saw you learn all the way, want a gig. And so I became the chief innovation officer at a company called Immersive Media.

They're the creators of Google Street View. So I was like, wow, this is pretty amazing. I'm sitting here watching like history unfold. And so a little tidbit about immersive street view, or, Google Street View was, it was called Immersive Street View until five minutes before they revealed it.

So there was an eight year gag order that immersive media had to not say anything about Google Street View. So that gave me that little, that rambunctious, rebellious fight, the man. And so that's how I've been my entire life. Anarchist cookbook, reading it through, hacking my buddy's computers just to see if it could be done.

And so a lot of the things that I've learned along the way is just by doing it. So I got into Immersives Media. They had this weird tech that just mapping. So I managed to do a dog and pony show, went to every agency I could in New York, every agency in Austin, most agencies in Chicago. And in the first year and a half working there, managed to accumulate over a hundred awards.

So won a Emmy won a couple dozen can Lions three, what are they called? Grand Prix, which is like the the creme to the creme of the awards. And so here I was from Saskatoon and I'm working with these amazing brands. And it was all because I just kept on doing things I didn't know how to do.

Now I'm in the realm of doing more things. I went from the immersive media. We got acquired by Digital Domain, from Digital Domain. We got into most of the VR applications in virtual production. So this was a decade ago when we started seeing this, or when I started seeing it, and now it's everywhere.

So it was interesting to see what's coming around the corner for decades and decades again. And so what's funny is. Technology's finally caught up to a lot of folks, and for some people they're catching up to the technology. But now that democratization of access, now you can just go out willy-nilly, start doing stuff, learning from it, make mistakes, surrender, find out what happens to you next, and that's the only permission slip you need.

So that's my time, I think. Appreciate you guys and thanks for accommodating me in my freestyle session.

All right, that's the one. So poor Kevin. I did not give him a heads up ahead of time that I would be asking for us to pull up the hackathon site. But he is a wizard. Hackathon dot bc ai.net. Nice and easy. I am also going to ask both Julia and Dale from Rival Technologies to come up here please.

They're the reason there's a prize money attached. So clap harder. Yeah. If you guys are unaware of what the hackathon is we thank you. AI in partnership with Rival Technologies are running a data storytelling hackathon. And I don't know about all of you, but when I first heard the term hackathon over the years, I assumed it was programming all of the time.

It turns out it's not. It just means like hacking the system. And so we're trying to change the way that storytelling with data is done because long PowerPoints with a bunch of context list graphs are really boring. And I had the pleasure of designing the first survey which began with the question, is a hotdog a sandwich?

Let me tell you the sentiment analysis in that data. People did not like this question. But yeah, so the data hackathon, or data storytelling hackathon, we are running four times over the course of this year. Each round has a $2,500 prize attached to it for the winning submission. So that is one reason why you ought to take a look and participate. Other reasons include, it's cool take what for what fits for you. I'm sure you have a lot of questions about it, and we will get to those, the, a lot of the information, I think all of the information, but we'll find out in this question period, is on the hackathon website, which is hackathon dot bc ai.net.

The data has been out for a few weeks now. The first round of submissions is due April 16th and the winner will be announced at next month's meetup. And with that base information given, I am going to hand this over to either Dale or Julia, depending on whose slide appears behind me. Julia?

Julia, you are the winner. Hi everyone. Hi. So I am [[Julia Morton]]. I'm VP of Customer Success at Rival Tech. We are a local, I think we can still call ourselves a startup. We've been around about eight years now. We are a market research technology company, so what that means is we help brands.

Connect with their customers, connect with their communities. We work with some pretty cool brands, some pretty huge brands that you've heard of. People like Warner Brothers, Pepsi Ora Ring, we were just talking about them earlier tonight. And lots of others. And every brand in the world does research, does surveys, talks to their customers to understand them better, to understand how to sell them things better essentially.

And a lot of the way that the data they collect is presented is pretty dull. You've probably participated in surveys, you may have seen the results of surveys. It's a lot of charts and graphs and PowerPoint presentations. And at Rival, we're really trying to reimagine how data is presented.

We use a lot of AI in our tool, but we don't really use tons of it. Dale's coming up with some pretty cool ways of visualizing data in new ways using ai. But we wanted to throw it out to this community. Our CEO, Andrew Reed, who a lot of you probably have met, he comes to this meetup.

This is his brainchild. He couldn't be here tonight. But yeah, we just, wanna see what this community comes up with. As Brittany mentioned, it was a pretty controversial topic. It turns out we had some interesting responses. So very curious to see what everyone here comes up with.

Thanks so much. How did you get here? Oh, how did I get here? How did I get here? Yeah, like the bus, but how did you okay, so I, my background's in journalism actually. That's what I did my education in at Carleton University. I'm from Vancouver though, and I have to say I'm being a lifelong vancouverite.

I'm not used to people being so friendly here. You may know that reputation of Vancouver, whether you're from here or not. So it's cool tonight to connect with some of you and have people actually, want to talk to each other and be friendly and open. And so this is a pretty cool community, I think, to be a part of.

Yeah, and I, after journalism's kind of came back to Vancouver not knowing what to do with myself 'cause I didn't wanna be a journalist anymore. And eventually got into the tech space, fell into market research and project management, and worked for a few of those companies here. And then eventually joined Rival to start our customer success arm and be the client facing side of the company.

And Dale is one of the founders of that company, so he'll let him tell a little bit himself. I'm gonna, yeah, please do. Part of the reason I'm so stoked about this is 'cause so many of you, like Kush, like Andre, are like building products and tools that are interacting with ais that are scrubbing big data.

And like you guys have ideas and perspective about what's going on out there. So I'm trying to connect these guys who are like, what the fuck? Is going on in the world of AI with storytelling with y'all who are always like, Hey, I got all this new shit I wanna unleash upon the world. So that's really what we're doing here is like these guys put the money up, y'all have all these ideas and products and projects you all are building, you're always sharing with me and I'm trying to connect the two.

So anyway, Dale, it's your turn, bro. Thanks. I just, who cares about me? What about, questions about the hackathon I work at Rival? There's a bunch of us here from Rival. You guys wanna stand up and say hi? Just wave. We started something from the hackathon so far. Has anyone building anything here so far, or anyone in this group?

1, 2, 3. Is there any questions? I've done a few hackathons over the year where, I dunno, at this time, I'm always kinda wondering how are these things gonna be judged? What do I need to pay attention to if I wanna win this thing? Is there any questions about that? I was gonna be judged.

Actually, I just happen to have that right here. Let me just pull that up. I think we've got 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1. Here it is. The first criteria is creativity and innovation, which is what you would expect 25% goes to that we're looking for. Wow. We're looking for, wow. I haven't seen data represented like that before or a story told like that before.

Then we've got clarity and effectiveness, another 25%. So it needs to be understanding, understandable and meaningful. And then engagement and impact for 20%. Does it leave an emotional mark, an intellectual mark, and then tech technical execution, is it skillfully executed? And then of course, community value for 10.

So those are the lenses we're gonna look through. We're doing this to create collisions in the community. This isn't about us, it's about you guys. We're really big fans of what Kris Krüg and team are doing here. Really believe in the mission, really believe in this idea of future proving creatives and think that sometimes just having a project to create collisions is what you need.

We wanna create kind of maker momentum, so to speak. And so we're really excited to be a part of this community, to be able to contribute something like this and to see what comes out of it. And we hope this is the beginning of more of this kind of stuff. If there, is there any other questions about this topic?

If not, I'm conscious. We're short on time alright, good. How will you use this technology? Build something for you? This is a great question. It speaks to intellectual property. So you're not looking to steal people's ideas, so talk about that. I'm looking to steal your storytelling chops.

You're a good storyteller, man. This isn't about us. This is about you guys. And so if you guys have something and it wins and you feel like you want to commercialize that in some capacity, we're here to help you do that. We're not here to take it so we can connect you with the industry 'cause that's what we do.

And so we're here to mentor that engagement. Put it in front of brands like Warner Brothers and John Deere and, companies that want to connect with their customers, connect with real human stories and and so yeah, this is, again, it's not about us, it's about you guys. We'll make it, it happen.

Speak to this a little bit too, 'cause I don't work for the company, but I know that Andrew's looking to hire people. So in some ways this is a bit of an audition. You could win the money, you could get a job also some of the smartest people here that I've talked to are building like underlying technology that the outputs of those things are what wins the hackathon.

So the output could win the hackathon, but you build someone something else underneath the thing and you're just using that to produce the winning results. So it's like nobody's looking to steal no one's ideas. Here we're looking to build something together. And these guys have been totally awesome.

Great. Do you got anything else to say Dale? No, thanks Juliet. Questions? Come ask him questions and say hi. Yeah, I want sev Kush to report to the stage. We're signing off here. Kush you down. Come up for a sec. Sev.

You guys might have come to see my buddy Sev talk tonight. I flubbed a couple of his links and it didn't work out. So he's gonna give a promo here for his talk next month pretty soon. I just wanted to give you a chance to wrap it up like you're such a great, interesting, outspoken voice in our community.

You got up here the other day and you shouted out about why the fuck isn't anybody paying attention to deep seek, prejudice, all this kind of shit. And then UBC went on to make some weird banning of deep seek, nothing else, or whatever. And I ain't inviting you up here to talk about that necessarily, but mostly just what's on your mind, where you at?

And maybe we just say goodbye to everybody and just wrap things up around here. Sure. Okay. That's the spot. Okay. So I was not expecting so I just randomly came up. I have nothing particularly useful to say for sure. I mean it's obvious but I guess to the point that Crystal's making just to pat my own back in January, I was talking about how we need to be enjoying and appreciating and encouraging open source and people researching and sharing it openly because that is the foundation on which we will get a kind of world that I personally wanna see and maybe you all want to see as well if you see the value in it.

And and in the spirit of that hate that's deep seek was getting and China was getting and so on, was perhaps unwarranted and not helpful. And I got the sense sorry, my heart's racing 'cause I was random up here. I wasn't expecting it. In this. So when I was mentioning it on in January, I got the feeling that people didn't quite get that was a thing.

People thought I was just ranting about something that I cared about. And it wasn't really an argument against something, but just, I just thought that you guys thought that when really UBC went ahead and actually and added a policy just this week that says Deep seek is banned completely across the university on all networks, on all computers for UBC as well as, students at Deep Seek, I say students at U BBC won't be able to use it on their phones if they're connected to the data.

So you to wifi, which by the way, you basically need wifi at the campus 'cause like it's pretty deep and buildings are like dense and you won't have data access. So fundamentally it's a problem. And so that's like a real thing they did that they explicitly said this one app that is a Chinese app, I'm banning it while open AI explicitly, they said G-I-G-B-T if not, have no plans to banning it.

We have no plans for banning anthropic or anything it, so the case that they're making is about privacy and and rights and so on. But it's a moronic case 'cause they don't know what the fuck's going on and they're just making a policy out of xenophobia, out xenophobia, whatever the fuck it may be.

And so they're clowns, I wanna just say it explicitly, whoever made this policy and is it's on you guys who understand open source to protest it, to tell these people not to, go ahead and but their heads into things that they don't and actually, let the students do their research.

Contribute openly and follow the lead of the researchers at Deep Sea in China who have launched full technical papers, open weights, and shared as much as they legally can about the research that they're doing, unlike OpenAI. Unlike Anthropic.

Thanks Kal. Thank you for always having a little bit of that prepared. Anytime I call on you, I encounter that. Yes. Who? I can't see who's talking right now. Come on up. You drove up from Seattle. I was here. Oh my God.

Oh just one sec. Let me just warn you. He won't not stop. That's okay. I invite this conversation because Can I give you a hug? Yeah. Oh my God. Thank you. Nice to see you. So I'm wondering, we tried deep seek two, but they failed like a hundred different security tests and I'm all for open source and hugging face and some of the things that are more secure.

So what's your argument or how can you have people protect themselves and keep their data private? And not that it's China, I'm worried about it's that the platform itself is not secure. It failed every security safety test. I can ask him. Okay. Come on up. Bring,

and also, were you raising your hand? No. They're both here. They're hanging out. Kayam, the keynote speaker would like to weigh in. No I think the answer should come in first. I really do appreciate that question. 'cause I will. I talked to you before about projects you're working on with stable diffusion, so I am quite confident that you're coming from a place of real knowledge and not some kind of bias against any of this.

So I, I know where you're coming from. And so the question you're talking about is not just so there's two questions, right? When you go about security. One is sorry, this is like a big light in my face. One is security in terms of web security, right? Like encryption transfer in flight encryption and so on.

So when you send data there, is it all gonna be read by a hundred people across way and all the other stuff, web security, old school stuff? The other is LLMs. In general, when you ask a language model, can you be, can you prompt inject it? Can you get it to answer things you don't want? Will your application be secure?

Will it Toyota, customer service model be saying here's a free car. Those are two very different domains. The second one is a non-starter. 'cause every model has use, and if you're open sourcing the model, then it's, you have full ability to actually modify it and fine tune it as to your case, open AI and then dropping actually don't allow you to do that.

So it's much more secure to have deep seek or so on because you'll be able to build on top of it by downloading the weights off fucking face. But the first one, yeah, I'm not really sure how good the encryption and everything else is in the app that DPC has. I'm not necessarily advocating that everyone should be using these online apps anyway.

I think if you use OpenAI Chat g PT or Deep Seeks chat, chat app or cloud or anything else, it's fine. Use it. I don't care either way. I think you should probably be downloading the model and running it locally anyway. Or actually there's open Router, there's a bunch of other ones I've been using recently, fireworks ai, which I've actually, I'm not advertising anyone because I don't really know how good they are or if they're gonna last, but in their terms of service, they were saying they have zero data retention and that they're providing relatively faster, like token per second plus latency to first token than like what I've seen for a while.

So I was pretty excited to use that. So yeah, use those there. The inte encrypted, it'll be fully zero retention if they are to be believed or download the model locally if you want to use it. But if you're gonna use an app, then just expect that someone's hack your phone anyway and they have all the data regardless.

Like that's a different matter on a completely deep seek is doing the best they can. Thank you for that. I'm just parallel to this. When we're looking at models and anything that we have, if we look at companion ai, apple intelligence, the word or the phrase end-to-end encryption was something that we used to believe in.

And we, we fostered a belief that WhatsApp had our back. 'cause we could talk, bullshit about everybody, but it was protected. And then same thing with signal. So as soon as companion intelligence came out, it was like I am gonna date myself here, but Maxwell's smart in the cone of silence, right?

So you got cone of 86 and 99 are sitting there cone of silence. What? But there's a microphone in each one. So the end-to-end encryption still exists. However, the intelligence on the perception layer, not on the application layer, the perception layer, every type or keystroke you type it remembers, right?

So we're getting into fuck up model, any of those things. Your phone itself has been now created an end-to-end encryption moot because anyone who has an Apple phone, apple intelligence, as soon as you send a message and you send it to someone who has also has companion intelligence on their desktop, on their phone, that is completely open.

I haven't been on Facebook, haven't logged in for five years. I'm talking to someone on Signal three days ago. They're like, dude, I just got a friend request from you on Facebook. You haven't used it in five years. And I go, yeah, that's 'cause anti and encryption is done. He like, yeah, I noticed.

So what's happening is even if you have open source, and I love it. Open source on a perception layer. These are things that you have to start thinking about because they're gonna wrap it up going, Hey, guess what? You just have to give us this and we'll make your life easier. This convenience, it's so amazing.

You don't even have to think. And convenience stays in that invisible mode. So it used to be visible when we're like, Hey, I went to the grocery store, I went to Blockbuster, and now we just press a button. I don't see the 150, 175 fulfillment centers, the 150 million square feet of whatever warehouse.

All I get, and this was in my talk, 'cause I ran outta coffee and I pressed a button and before I woke up, the fucking coffee was there. Magic. But the magic comes with invisibility. And that invisibility comes at a price, that convenience. Every time you get convenience, you relinquish power. Yeah, so you have to look at this.

I'm not bullshitting it. Go look it up. Even Meredith was saying, if from signal, the CEO goes, Hey, this is her job, right? Every day she looks at this. So the fact that every last bit and she makes the comment, Hey, when you go poop, do you close the door? And I ask this to someone, she's no, I don't.

I go, but when you go to a party, do you close the door? Oh yes. So that is what we're talking about. It's not do, I don't have anything to hide. That's Nazi propaganda, by the way. So when you say that, wow, come on. So yeah go. Go. Thank you. So just to address your question around security, do you think that maybe real time monitoring might come into play?

Or what does real time monitoring after the could that maybe replace encryption? Elaborate you mean by, I got it. So real time monitoring in terms of maybe hijacking your account. At least it's one thing for you to be aware that, these bad guys have coming to your system.

But then again, where encryption and protection security comes into play is there's nothing, right? There's like nothing. There's little the do d The DOD, yeah. The DOD in the us. I also wanna point out American

lying. Yeah. So to contextualize, yeah. But those three, the little three letter acronym agencies are monitoring and they are all over WhatsApp. And they will contact you if you write something that they don't agree with or that they think is a threat. And I, and it's end-to-end, encrypted, private, all of that.

But it's not really, it's not if I so appreciate your point. Just one I thing. I No, I love your here. Thanks for staying. Can we all agree to like, speed around, because these two guys are all literally, one moment. I love what you said. And explicitly the thing is I operate on this already, although I have a Google account and Gmail and everything, so I guess I don't care fundamentally, but it exactly is that is if you really care about true security, like that's your concern.

Don't expect anything that you're using on the cloud or whatever to give you that. That's a different thing. I think if you're trying to go for the best model for responding to customer service queries or the best model for coding or the best model for your agent that you're building, or Jarvis or whatever.

Separate question. But I would think in 2025 and after Snowden in 2013, come on. Are you fucking expecting security on your phone? It is not happening. So don't think that for that reason you're gonna use chat GPD and then I'm gonna retain your history just to give you guys more fodder from the no.

You're staying there. Okay. Hello and thank you. And okay. I'm telecommunication engineer and like telecommunication, our goal is transport something that we don't know. What is it? Yeah. And the point here and about your, or regarding to your question is it's more about control. Yeah. Because I feel that you wanna know what is the control that the applications have about and deep seek show to everybody that you only don't have you, you only don't have the control about how the things work.

It's how it works and how you can manage and you can, could create the model for it. Yeah. And I think this is the point here that, and I'm a little bit agree with you, it's just the weak thing here is that we have to know many things about for modeling. But I think that the with deep seek the world open a little bit, it's just we have to I agree, know and create more continuous about the information that we give.

It's I have my kids from my house here and it's here, but I could turn around and the people could drive make a draw about, yeah. Or do something about. It's how I control it because the information is generated by myself, not by anyone have a burning response. Otherwise, I'm gonna let the next Yeah, I think I'll just take it up from your point.

I think all of you're correct trying to be the voice of balance here. I'm trying to build sensors for DOD and government applications. So you have to keep in mind the use case that that is that you're using AI for. Having said that, if you're doing some some math puzzles or rational rational applications, deep six pretty it's pretty helpful.

It works. So it, I think it comes down to, hey, evaluate your goddamn application and then determine what model you want. Yep. If you want to hear my friend from the DOD and my anarchist friend talk about open source technology at the next meetup, you guys are all welcome to show up. Caem. You wanna say the last word?

Actually, I'll say one thing. Thank you guys for being here. Thanks for sticking around. This is like where the good shit happens, where we crosspollinate brains. We got about half an hour left that I put out 150 donuts. There are the open bars going on, hang out for a little while and then fuck off by 10 to the observatory 'cause that's what my contract says.

Also, guys we were never allowed to drink or eat in here, but we now are because they respect us. 'cause we respect them. So clean up for yourself and your neighbor and your whole road. Make sure every little bits and bobs is gone before we go and that means we can keep doing what we're doing around here.

Thank you. Thank you very much guys. Ca am I only had one last thing. We were talking about open source. We're talking about all these models. Everyone needs to look at. Mara on December 7th, 2023, gave up their model weights and basically open AI's IP and Anthropics ip. And so no one really recognized what that did.

So 400 employees at open AI, or sorry anthropic 500, 600 at OpenAI, and then it got distributed to about 20,000 people. So open source and models and weights. So after that you noticed OpenAI and Anthropic went very product oriented. Because they have no ip, because Mara took their legs from underneath them.

Ma, thank you. So Mara, if you're going to make informed decisions, go YouTube some shit on Myra, learn about it, utilize that and look at how they're doing their research. Open source, but closed, private, that doesn't make sense. Open source is open source. So when we're moving forward, you gotta look at that.

Lean so hard into Myra. There's got so many deep things. It was a team from France that laid the boots down to billion dollar companies. We've got this deep seek thing going on. 6 million, million dollars. Dude, these guys did it way before. They're just French. No one heard about it. So anyways, ra, open source, make good choices.

You guys sign off too. Real quick. Sign off then we're over now. Can't thank you. I will, I'll say that I knew the spirit. The question was gonna be, I was like, I can't see how she's really gonna be countering. I know your views, you're pretty much on my side. And it was exactly that. You were buffering the point, which is that we need to be a lot more conscious.

We are just a lot more conscious of what we are doing. And I think I, as I think Kris Krüg was saying in January, we do actually generally agree on the goals. We do want a more positive open world. But I just feel like sometimes there's so much propaganda going on and we forget based on what Sam Altman's putting out, like we think, oh, maybe that is actually the positive.

There is not, whatever Sam Altman says is a lie. Pretty much think the opposite. So hang on. Cheers.
