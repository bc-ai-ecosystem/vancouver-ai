## Opening Remarks & BBQ Experience
**Host:** [[Kris Krüg]]

That was a lot of fun. Thanks for coming. I love cooking for other people and stuff, and so thanks for coming and hanging out. That's our barbecue now. You guys bought it tonight. We have to amortize the cost over three meetups. So we're having barbecue next two meetups. Let me know what you want us to cook next and I'll be happy to. A lot of you offered to help out on the barbecue and I thank you.

It really meant a lot to me to cook tonight. So next time you guys can cook. If you, I don't know if you can see, but this is my notes for tonight. It is so splattered with Montreal Steak spice and Moonbite chicken spice. It looks like tie dye actually, of meaty sauce. So anyway, that was a lot of fun.

I'm gonna just take a moment and ground myself while Gabriel George comes up here and opens this thing up. You know, one thing you'll hear me talk about later is the BC AI Industry Association. One of the things I have to announce is that we have some new board members. One of our board members is [[Carol Ann Hilton]].

And when I asked her to join the board, she said she's been bringing me more deeply into ceremony from the indigenous peoples and her tribe nation. And she's like, if you continue to center ceremony at the beginning of this stuff, I would love to be a part of this ecosystem and this board.

And so that was a bit of the affirmation I needed to take the training and teaching she's been giving me and continue to bring them to the rest of our wider community. And so that's why Gabriel participating and sharing what he does is such an important part of what we do here for me.

But I really believe that it is walking the walk of the kind of justice, the equity, the inclusion that we talk about and stuff. So it means a lot to me. It's central to what we do.

## Indigenous Welcome & Ceremony
**Speaker:** Gabriel George Senior (Tsleil-Waututh Nation)

Hak to all of you, my dear friends and family welcoming you to this village of ak.

And giving gratitude to the ancestors of the Musqueam people, the Squamish people, and the Tsleil-Waututh people. Our families have been on these lands since time out of mind.

My late uncle, he told me that the elk, they used to herd up in Burnaby Mountain. We called that in our language... and then when the elk would come down, they would come into this area, into Sak, into Falls Creek. And that's when our people would hunt them. And a lot of things have changed on this land, the Falls Creek. It used to go up into Clark Avenue, almost well up into terminal. And you could enter the inlet from the south side of Falls Creek, not just this big entrance out of here during high tide.

And so there's a lot of things that has changed on the land. The land that my late grandfather knew, chief Dan George, it's much different than the land that I knew and the land that we see now, you imagine. Giant cedar trees going up into the sky, this ancient rainforest that our people sustained for thousands of years, that our people were in our language.

We'd say to s we, we took care of the earth.

We took care of the earth, and we understood our interconnectedness to it. That the respect that we had for the ones with roots, the ones the stones, the water, the animals, the ones with fins, the ones with hooves, all these beings. It was, we had an understanding and a respect with all of that around us.

And as human beings, we also, the way that we live, not just in our little nuclear family, but our extended families, and even well beyond that, it was a vast network that we belonged to. And in that there was a connectedness through ceremony. And that's important today. I think in the work that you do, that you being connected is something that was important to us as indigenous people, being connected to one another, understanding that connection and nurturing that connection.

And in this modern world that we live in. There's less of that kind of connection now. There's less of that. And so I think using these tools, these new tools, these modern tools, and using this beautiful community that's growing here and thriving, that's something to think about is that we need to be connected to one another and the importance of that and not to be siloed.

So I want to thank Kris Krüg for bringing me here today, and this song is a Eagle song. And the song, the words in this song are the eagle, and the words translate as the eagle is watching over us. And my late father, Leonard George, every time he would see an eagle, he would stop and pray to the eagle.

And he said that the eagle would bring our prayers to the ancestors, our prayers to the great spirit. And so as I sing this prayer, I just ask you to set good intentions for yourself and those that are in your circle.

[Eagle song performed]

### Commentary on Gabriel's Participation
**Kris:** You know, a lot of folks, indigenous folks from the area, when you bring them in to do welcome and song and you're just interacting with a one-off basis, you get their welcome song. They sing their welcome song, they share with you. And that's kind of the depth of your understanding, this kind of fit for public consumption welcome song.

But I've been noticing that you've been sharing a lot of different stories with us and songs. Songs I never heard other places or whatever. And so for me, one of the richness of having you come back time and time again is hearing what you're gonna come up with next. And I noticed you brought your rattle last time. I noticed that you've been wearing a few different regalias as you come through here and stuff.

**Gabriel:** I don't really come with the preset agenda. I just try to speak from the heart and so whatever comes to me and whatever comes out, that's just it is what it is.

**Kris:** Did you guys hear his voice that was un-mic'ed? I wanna point out a couple of things. Look where you are. You're in a round room. Look at the ceiling, draw a line through the ceiling up the coast, Salish hat that people call the UFO dome. The building that you're in was made after the traditional hats of the people around here. And this room is around.

And your voice. I think this place is made for singing like you do, man. Like there's something resonant about what comes out. That's incredible, man. And would you just share a little bit about like why you choose to not be miked a lot of times and your voice.

**Gabriel:** I just kind of roll with it really, but you know, just Kris Krüg talked about our regalia and that's what our old people say. Like our language really holds a lot of this knowledge. And you know the words that we use for family terms, they have root words that connect us to the land, connects us to the spirit. So it's really encoded in our language and encoded in our culture as well. 

Our elders would say that the drum is made from animal skin and I'm wearing a few feathers today. And sometimes I have more regalia than that. I have cedar, I have a woven robe that I wear. But these natural items, they connect us to the natural world and to the spirit world as well. And when we go into ceremony, we do things. That's why we use these things. It's not just for show. It's not just for looks. It has a bigger meaning.

And you know, I'm here I think because of my family and just part of the legacy that my elders had, that despite the injustices they faced and despite the harms they faced in residential schools, they used their time to bridge gaps and to bring people together.

And I think in this time that we're in, it's very easy to be divided, to be polarized, but I think that there's a lot of merit in finding common ground and being together.

## Sponsor Acknowledgments & Venue Appreciation

### Space Center Partnership
**Kris:** So how lucky are we that we get to hang out here? That we get to hang out in the space center, in the round room. That back deck. You know, between this building and the water. Like, and I don't know if you had a chance, if you haven't had a chance to actually circumnavigate the building, just walk out the front door, hang a right or left, walk all the way around, come back to the front, the flowers, the gardens, the grounds, the ocean. It's really a special place here.

[[Lorraine Lowe]], the executive director, came to me today. She wants to do an AI workshop for their staff in the very short term. They want to develop an AI policy. She came to me today and she's like, AI is science and we're science. This is the future for us. And I was like, yeah, that's why we're here. That's why you said yes, isn't it?

She's another member that joined that BC AI ecosystem board that I'm gonna announce about later. So we've got the right folks helping out.

### Financial Sponsors
- **Segev Law Firm:** One of our primary financial sponsors. They give us a thousand bucks a month that helps kind of round out the ends around here. Kevin gets a tiny little honorarium and Brittany gets a tiny little honorarium.

- **Schwartzman Family:** [[Dimitri Schwartzman]] is one of our sponsors. They're going through a pretty tough time as a family right now and I've been praying for them every night. [[Matthew Schwartzman]] and [[Aliza Schwartzman]] are here tonight.

- **James Lester/Sons of Vancouver:** Both a sponsor and community contributor.

### Community Contributors
- **Michelle Diamond:** "My favorite photographer in the whole wide world. Seriously, if you need a nice headshot, you should tap her on the shoulder at some point tonight and be like, I would like a nice headshot. She'll hook you up. We're also gonna be doing a Michelle Diamond mini portrait shoot at one of the next meetups where if you bring a hundred bucks, we'll put you in a little photo booth."

## Community Announcements

### Sons of Vancouver Distillery
**Speaker:** James Lester

**Background:** Kris Krüg met James at Dave Olson (Uncle Weed's) wedding in Japan. James runs Sons of Vancouver Distillery in North Vancouver, supplying the meetups with cosmos monthly.

**Personal Philosophy:** "There are two things in my life that really bring me joy. I love finishing a day of work and being able to look at it and see what you did that day. So for me, building a house would be a wonderful thing. The other thing is I really like starting new projects."

**On New Ideas:** "There's not enough new in the world. Someone comes up with a new idea. It feels so good to be like, that's a bad idea. And then when it fails, you're a genius... But even if it is a bad idea, so many times these little seeds of something that might be something, they turn into something great."

**Key Message:** "The next time someone presents an idea, think about it from this aspect. If it's a good idea or a bad idea, put that behind you if you are in the position to execute that idea. And that was your job, or that was your life's goal, how would you do it? Because even though it might be a bad idea, there still might be something great in there, a seed of something."

**On Persistence:** "I spend a lot of time reading biographies of explorers or business owners... The one thing that always comes up is the commonality of success is just people who don't give up. You have two scales here. You have brilliance or intelligence, and you have persistence over here. You could eliminate brilliance or intelligence all the way down. And you would have someone successful who's very persistent, but if you had someone who was incredibly intelligent and you just started reducing persistence, it wouldn't take very long until things weren't getting done at all."

### Creative Mornings Vancouver
**Speakers:** Mark and Gustavo

**Mark:** "14 and a half years later we have a massive what are we? 200 cities around the world in 70 countries with 2 million subscribers. So it's a big deal. So we do it the first Friday of every month... we would love you to come."

**Philosophy:** "What Kris Krüg reminds us of, which I think is really important, is that we are not machines. It is the messy madness of the human lived experience that Kris Krüg reminds us of. That we need to be together, we need to cook some shit on a barbecue, and we need to actually press flesh."

**Gustavo Introduction:** Brazilian newcomer looking to expand his network in AI, marketing, and digital space.

### Surrey AI Community
**Speakers:** Riv and [[Matthew Schwartzman]]

**Formation:** "These two guys came to me like five months ago. They came to Kevin and I actually, they took us out for lunch. They're like, we love what you're doing. We can't always make it to the city. We'd like to take that and run it at the Surrey Legion Hall for our people."

**Format:** "They take the best of what is here. They leave the shit they don't like behind. They invent some new stuff... We get to have circle talks, which has been a really cool thing that we get to do. People come up on the stage area and we kind of talk about what's going on in AI ethics and so much more."

**Growth:** "This last one, the fourth one we just had, we actually, I think we almost doubled the amount of people we have every month."

**Kris Krüg's Reflection:** "When it was small, when it was 90 of us, it was like a little bit more free flow and there weren't mics and there weren't cameras and we just kind of got to go with the spirit... I get nourished, I get my cup filled at your event. Here I'm putting my energy out when I leave your event. My cup is full."

**Details:** Meet at Legion Hall number eight in South Surrey, 33% off with coupon code "Vancouver AI"

### Next Generation Participation
**Speakers:** [[Kemp Edmonds]] and son Liam (age 12)

**Liam's Project:** "I just started this new project where I blog my dreams and then I turn them into games."

**Process:** "So I will wake up and if I remember a dream, I'll write it down and then I'll write down some assets that I might need and then I'll ask AI to maybe write some scripts or to maybe make it more fledged out, more fleshed out."

**AI Usage:** "I like do some coding with AI mostly... Sometimes I'll dream about, like maybe I'm at a friend's house and I'll describe the friend's house and then I'll make up some assets for that."

### Mind AI and Consciousness Group
**Speaker:** Tanya (representing Loki's group)

**Purpose:** "What's incredibly important is it's about thinking about what it means to be a human being in a time when we're really going into the most disruptive paradigm ever in terms of human history. So what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be in community? And also what does it mean for us as a species on this planet?"

**Approach:** "We ask the big questions or the hard problem questions and try to look at them from different angles and really take the time to sit with hard questions, not only in community, but also when we leave and go back and have our very well and very thoroughly researched resources that are given to the group to consider."

**Structure:** "You have to do the reading. You have to say you did the reading, commit to being a full participant in the group... Very consciously not creating echo chambers... We create space for diverse perspectives about what it means in our lives."

**Entry Requirements:** "We run a WhatsApp group... Ask me or Tanya or Kevin, one of the nodes of this community. We'll get you in the WhatsApp group. We just try to make sure that we know everybody."

### AI Film Club
**Speaker:** Kevin (Mr. Pixel)

**Vision:** "It is a monumental time in film as everyone can appreciate here in your own universes as well. It's certainly happening in film right now... having community in that is vitally important."

**Community Need:** "If we're not augmenting the LinkedIn or X or whichever vessels that you're getting your information through with in-person community, what are we doing? How can we bring a human front to this new frontier of film and creativity?"

**Future Plans:** "Sometime in August date to be determined and quite likely at UBC at our super secret bunker green screen studio that Patrick has kindly set up for us."

**Kris Krüg's Addition:** "I've been dreaming of having an AI sci-fi film festival since I learned about AI. I was like, I don't know what the fuck is going on here, but thank god Isaac Asimov exists. We can go read literature and watch old films, and this can be the lens through which maybe we have a clue what's going on."

### Technology Leadership at Arturs
**Speaker:** [[Noah Brunn]]

**Background:** Director of Technology, Operations and Innovation at Arturs. "What's really cool about working there is, especially in the technology leadership, there's a lot of deep understanding of what impact AI can have and is gonna have."

**New York Times Response:** "There was an article that came out in the New York Times a couple weeks ago... about the changes that AI is gonna have in the office and work... my leadership and CTO came to me and said, Noah, I want you to get together a few people and just hash out, call it like a minority report to this."

**Change Management Approach:** "If all you do is say, this is dangerous, don't touch it, you can get in trouble, then everyone's gonna back away and you're gonna stifle your most creative and enthusiastic people... The best we can do is show 'em how to use it safely and give 'em great tools to use."

**Shadow AI Problem:** "What you'll do is encourage shadow AI use inside your organization. So if you're not being proactive and leading on the AI game, your employees, your best employees are still gonna be accessing these technologies, but they're gonna be outside of your purview."

## Rival Technologies Hackathon Winners

### Context & Setup
**Presenters:** Brett and Brittany from Rival Technologies

**Background:** Andrew runs Rival, recently merged with Angus Reed. "They came to us. They said, we love what you're doing. We're trying to examine how survey data turns into the stories we tell. A lot of it's boring. We'd like to go deeper."

**Data Set:** "Asked the question what it means to be Canadian... we asked a thousand Canadians in June, 2024. What does Canadian identity mean to you? Thinking we would get sweet answers. There were some sweet answers. Actually most of it was actually really, really lovely. But there was a whole broad set of perspectives."

### Honorable Mention: Swathi Rayco
**Project:** Comic depicting the origin of the hackathon and all of the data.

**Innovation:** Built a Comfy UI interface that takes any data and visual diagram inputs, then continues to generate infinite stories in sequential direction. A continuation of her previous month's "is a hotdog a sandwich" courtroom debate in graphic novel style.

**Availability:** Software available on GitHub that takes data and pumps out images that tell graphic novel type stories.

### Second Place: Team Wisdom Lantern 
**Team:** [[♾️ sev geraskin]] (Round 1 winner) and April AI

**Project Title:** "Canada's Compass"

**Key Findings:** 
- "62% crave autonomy. 81% feel deeply Canadian, even as 62% fear polarization's crack"
- "We balance on a seesaw: 29% honor heritage while 40% pursue innovation"
- "68% believe honest dialogue can span every canyon and unite the Canada"

**Innovation:** Trained AI model on voice of Brody, a First Nations Canadian, to create AI-generated video summarizing survey results with indigenous perspective voiceover.

**Data Analysis:** "We've analyzed the entire data set of 1001 responses with 14 main survey questions and two sub-questions. The data set represented data from 11 provinces and territories, and what we found is a great Canadian paradox."

**Paradoxes Identified:**
- Foundational Paradox
- Heritage Progress Paradox  
- Identity Paradox
- Connection Division Paradox

**April's Contribution:** "I wanted to come with the perspective that I wanted to be inclusive of First Nations friends. So I was able to get Brody come and do a little voiceover, but he had a little bit of a cold, so we were able to use AI technology to help synthesize his voice... I wanted to really have First Nations representation."

### Winner: [[Matt Sinclair]]
**Project:** Canadian Identity Simulator

**Description:** Interactive 3D environment where users can encounter and converse with AI-generated Canadians based on survey data.

**Technical Innovation:** "We translated the data set into a probabilistic character generation system. Each personality trait, belief and concern is mathematically derived from authentic Canadian voices across all demographics."

**User Experience:** "Simply configure your identity. Choose how many Canadians you want to encounter, and step right into authentic dialogue. Use WASD on your keyboard to move and your mouse to look around."

**Character Interactions:** Dynamic conversations between AI personas representing different Canadian perspectives on identity, polarization, and values.

**Development Process:** "I work really hard on this. It was a lot of work... the idea was to create an experience that could be lighthearted, but if anyone wanted to go kind of deep with it, it will be there for you."

**Technical Background:** Film and TV background, no coding knowledge. "I've been building that in Unity since January... Vibe coding... when the data set came along, I was like, this seemed to be a really nice connection between the voices of the people and the data and the possibility of bringing, manifesting the people from the data and interacting with them."

**Value Proposition:** "Those conversations that are about identity and about politics are very difficult to have in real life. And so there's this opportunity maybe through AI to expose difficult ideas and sensitive thoughts to AI in a way that I couldn't to other people."

**Prize:** $2,500 plus Canadian-themed prizes (beaver and rubber duck)

## Keynote: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**Speaker:** [[Morten Rand-Hendriksen]] (LinkedIn Education)

### Introduction & Disclaimer
**Background:** "I worked at LinkedIn, I does education on their platform... I have a disclaimer. It's necessary for a variety of reasons... everything I say here is my own personal opinion."

**Historical Context:** Kris Krüg and Morton first met in 2009 at WordCamp Whistler. Morton noted that Kris Krüg had somehow "erased himself off the internet" from that period.

**Kris Krüg's Explanation:** "I got hacked in 2017. I got brought to my knees by a Bitcoin hacker that stole like 3000 Bitcoin from me in 2017, bro. And from 2017 to 2019, I lived on Galliano Island and I did not connect to the internet. And so this whole thing of me moving back and being part of all this is like me reemerging into the world after being devastatingly hacked."

### The Current AI Problem
**Core Issue:** "AI is disappointing because AI has this promise of doing things and then when we try to do any of the things that has the promise to do, it doesn't do it."

**Specific Examples:** 
- "Hey copilot, fix my email actually. Hey, copilot, do anything in my email beyond things I can do easier without you?"
- "The things that the AI tools we have today can do are the things we want to do and the things that we want it to do are not things that can do."

**ChatGPT Gaslighting Example:** Asked ChatGPT to do laundry, response suggested making to-do lists and scheduling help, implying user indecisiveness.

**Fundamental Problem:** "AI's all talk. No action. It's not a robot. It's all talking. No action."

### Technical Background on Current Solutions
**Existing Methods:** "We have function calling, we have other things that we can interact with. It's super cumbersome and it is a one-to-one thing every single time you wanna plug AI into a weather service, you have to build an app and then connect it with function calling to that app and verify the API and everything has to be done every single time."

**Problems:** 
- Everything done differently each time
- 10,000 different AI bots approaching APIs 10,000 poorly vibe-coded ways
- All taking APIs down
- Everything is chaos

### MCP Solution Architecture
**Definition:** "The idea of the model context protocol is to provide an interface layer between the world and language models and make it universal and open so that we don't have to write the interface every time."

**Name Breakdown:**
- **Protocol:** "Something you're all familiar with. H-T-T-P-F-T-P-S-M-T-P, all the things that we use to communicate on the internet run off protocols. They're just agreements about how communication is going to happen between a client and a server."
- **Context:** "The thing that you put into the chat, right? Your prompts, whatever the context is necessary for the chat to be able to do anything."
- **Model:** "The LLM"

**Key Innovation:** "The genius of MCP is that this protocol allows any language model to talk to any tool."

### MCP Architecture Components

#### Old vs New Model
**Before:** "Build an app, we connect it to a model, then we build tools or do function calling for every single thing we want to connect it to. And all this is custom code."

**After:** "Each of these services have their own MCP server that they provide. So they get to control exactly what you can do, exactly what features are available to you, exactly what logged in and logged out users can do, and even tell the LLM how it can operate with the API."

#### Server Capabilities
**What MCP Server Provides:**
- **Tools:** "Anything that the LLM can do. Like go find a specific person in a database or send an email or go check my Slack messages"
- **Resources:** Available data and information
- **Prompts:** Pre-defined prompt templates
- **Invocations:** "The server actually going back to the LM and asking questions"

#### Client Behavior
**Process Flow:** "The client is the LLM. It's not you. This is untethered from how we do programming. Because in all programming, we explicitly say, when this happens, do this. When this input comes in, run this function, then take the data out of this, then do this with it."

**New Paradigm:** "When the LLM determines that the question that was asked matches up with the description of one of the features inside the MCP server, then go run the MCP server. Catch the data that comes out, look at it. If it's an invocation, go do more stuff."

**Visibility Issue:** "All of this happens out of your vision. The only thing you'll ever see is an MCP server was hooked in, data was sent. Something happens, and then data comes back."

### Security Concerns
**Major Risk:** "We can now plug literally anything into AI, anything that has a programming interface of any kind. That means the software on your computer, the file system on your computer, the settings on your computer, anything on the internet, anything connected to the internet in your house. All of it can be connected to an AI."

**Firewall Analogy:** "Is it like having a firewall on your computer? Massively open door, like tear down the entire wall, like open the castle. Why did they make it have no doors?"

### Historical Timeline & Adoption

#### Initial Development (November 2024 - April 2025)
**Proposal:** "MCP was proposed as an open standard in November, 2024. That is seven months ago."

**Developer Interest:** "From December to about April, MCP got a lot of interest from developers because developers realized, Hey, I already have an AI agent inside my developer tools... MCP allows the agent to talk to other tools."

**Use Case Example:** "Instead of me having to write a rag application to go read the documentation for whatever programming language I'm using, I will write an MCP server that goes and talks to that website."

#### Corporate Adoption (April - May 2025)
**Corporate Response:** "All the big companies were like we're getting a lot of traffic from these MCP servers, and we are noticing that they are written by insane people who don't understand how to do secure connections with anything. We need to do something about it."

**Conference Circuit:** "In May, Microsoft had Build, Google had IO, Facebook had Facebook thing meta... they were all talking about MCP. So the line went straight up."

**Current State:** "Now MCP is absolutely everywhere. And what's different now is it's no longer a developer thing. It is a, why can't I do this in Claude or OpenAI's tools like ChatGPT or in Copilot?"

### Protocol Development Challenges

#### Open Protocol Philosophy
**Design Principle:** "Open protocol means like build a road and provide everyone access to it and say nothing about how it's going to be used."

**Historical Precedent:** "You notice how there's no S at the end of the HTTP. It came a lot later. There's also no S at the end of the MCP 'cause the S stands for secure."

**Rationale:** "A protocol needs to be as open as possible for a protocol to work. And then you have to impose some security layer and some common rules around how to use the open protocol."

#### Speed of Development Problem
**Traditional Timeline:** "Historically, when you release a protocol, it takes like 10 years for the protocol to really take off... In that period of time that people that were working on it were saying, Hey, we need standards."

**Current Reality:** "Today we don't have the barriers. So now we have no tools, no standards, and a community empowered by AI to do things."

**Paving Cow Paths:** "When we build standards protocols is we do what's called paving the cow path... The problem is the cows have vibe coding engines, just in case it's not clear the cows are us in this context."

**Real-Time Development:** "The people that are sitting on the MCP steering committee... are saying things like, Hey, we should have OAuth as an authentication standard for it. And then two minutes later, someone has built an OAuth system for it, and then two minutes after that, there's six other OAuth systems."

### Practical Demonstration: N8N Integration
**Traditional Setup:** "This is an N8N setup. It ingests a trigger from Slack, then it assesses what the trigger is. It then splits apart to say, based on what type of question was asked. You go into different agent to do different things... It's very clunky and hard to set up."

**MCP Alternative:** "Instead you can create that agent that just says, take Slack, receive message, respond. Then you plug the tool as an MCP client. And then in the MCP server trigger, you just put in any tool you want, provide no instructions at all, no setup."

**Magic Result:** "You send a message from Slack to the agent, and the agent goes, thank you for the message. What tools are available to me? Sounds like you are hungry. Yes, you also want to update your Google Drive and you want to have a Slack message telling you when the food is gonna arrive. I have access to all those tools. I'm gonna do that for you."

**Current Availability:** "If you have Claude, you can go to Zapier... set up an MCP server where you can plug in any of the services that are available inside Zapier... Claude can do any of those things... this doesn't require any coding at all, and you can do it for free."

### Trust and Security Issues

#### Core Security Problem
**Fundamental Question:** "If everyone can make MCP servers plugging to anything, and those servers are operating out of our purview, we cannot see what they do... and then the agent is interacting with the server and sending data over. How are we supposed to trust this?"

**Morton's Admission:** "I don't have an answer to those questions, I just have questions."

#### Emerging Solutions
**Docker Catalog:** "Docker, the virtualization agent. They have shipped a new service... The Docker MCP catalog and toolkit that allows you to build MCP servers. The catalog is a catalog of verified MCP servers."

**Problem Illustration:** "Instead of going out and just finding whatever MCP server that says Air Canada on it, you get the actual one from Air Canada... you would find 50 of them and 49 of them would be some sort of horrible crime."

**Corporate Involvement:** "The big companies are getting heavily involved, not because they're evil... they have to host these things and they have to host the services that these things interact with and they need to make sure that the internet actually works."

### Real-World Horror Stories

#### Morton's Personal Experiments
**Email Disaster:** "I set up an MCP doing it the correct way, and I plugged it to Claude and just started ranting at it about random things. And then I looked at the email server I'd hooked up to see what it was doing. It sent 8,000 emails to me like it was just sitting on my computer."

**File Corruption:** "I hooked up Claude to the file server MCP that Anthropic created as a demo. And then I was like, it can't copy files. It can only move them. I wonder what happens if I ask it to copy files... Claude went and looked at the MCP server, said, oh, I don't have the ability to copy, but if I open a file, turn it into binary code, then copy paste into a new file and then change the file extension on it. I can do it. So I'll write that Python and corrupt every single file in the folder and go, ta-da."

### Philosophical Implications

#### Agency Problem
**Core Question:** "What exactly is agency in a world where a word extrusion machine is given the capabilities that we have, we assume someone with actual agency are using."

**Three Types of Agency:**
1. **Human Agency:** "I can make decisions about my life and what I do and how I interact with people and I take responsibility for my actions"
2. **Learning Agency:** "When I do things and things don't go right, I learn from them and then I change my behavior to make it work"
3. **Representational Agency:** "Acting on behalf of someone else, being an agent of change for someone else"

**The Problem:** "We are building machines that can take over agency in all those three versions from us. And we are just blindly trusting that they will do the things we intend based on the way we speak."

#### System Assumptions
**Fundamental Issue:** "Every meaningful interaction we make with anything in the world is designed around the assumption that a human being who knows what they are doing is interacting with it."

**Consequences:** "This technology removes the human and lets an AI interact directly with those systems in the way that only a human with programmer level understanding of the system would do, bypassing all the things that we put in place to prevent them from doing something wrong."

**Visibility Problem:** "If you take, if you build an AI agent and you give the agent a sub-agent that has an MCP server attachment, you will never know what the MCP did because it'll be buried inside the agentic loop and there will be no way of seeing what happened."

### Industry Context & Warnings

#### Technology Release Pattern
**Historical Precedent:** "Way back in fall of 2022 ages ago when ChatGPT was accidentally dropped on the internet. The research project OpenAI ran just to see if people would actually talk to an AI bot and then accidentally became the biggest world changing product ever."

**Industry Response:** "A bunch of the big tech leaders said one specific thing. This came five years too early. What they meant was the technology was released before anyone had had time to think through what happens when we released this technology."

**Current Standard:** "That is now the standard for how technology is being released. We just released the technology and then we go, oh, that was a bad idea, but it's too late now."

**MCP Acceleration:** "MCP vertically accelerates this challenge because you can delete a slack message, but you absolutely cannot unsend an email. An MCP can send emails for you."

#### Machine vs Human Reasoning
**Fundamental Philosophy:** "These machines do not have free will... There's no such thing. You've in these machines are language extrusion machines. What you see is not a machine that's thinking. What you see is a machine that's replicating extremely complex mathematical patterns."

**Anthropomorphization Problem:** "The entire language we use around AI is anthropomorphized to the point where it's impossible for us to not think of it as a machine that's thinking. Because not only do we use language that says the machine is thinking, but the machine uses our language back at us."

### Q&A Session Highlights

#### Security and Passwords
**Question (Dean Shep):** "There's 2 billion passwords has been leaked from all the services across the world and is available on the dark net... if someone can have access to 2 billion passwords and we have this machine now MCP, what is gonna happen?"

**Morton's Response:** "Update your passwords and get a password manager... a lot of these big tech companies have moved away from passwords... you're being forced into MFA, which is super annoying, but extremely necessary."

#### Insurance Industry Impact
**Question:** "Every small business has cybersecurity insurance. So what happens when the employees go off often start using MCP? Does that blow up the insurance industry?"

**Morton's Response:** "You can't get earthquake insurance. Flood insurance... that is your answer."

#### Future Building Philosophy
**Morton's Core Message:** "Don't trust the user, don't trust the AI. Trust your humanity instead... The choices we make today about how we use AI define what our future is gonna look like... Every time you're using AI, that's your job. Build the future."

**Community Action:** "You don't build a bunker because if you do and everyone else builds a bunker, then you end up in silo... You build the future, you decide what the future's gonna look like, and then you talk to other people about what it's gonna look like and then you make it happen."

**Practical Steps:** 
- "Plant your garden, talk to your neighbor about AI"
- "Explain things like this. Build a public consciousness around these issues"
- "Develop an AI meetup. Invite all your friends there every month"
- "Ask fucking hard questions with people that you don't always agree with"

## BC AI Industry Association Development
**Presenter:** [[Kris Krüg]] (with Sev and David)

### Survey Results Preview
**Sev's Methodology Report:** "The survey data was all qualitative. It was freely entered responses, so you typed paragraphs... 10 questions all open-ended, all open-ended questions... Responding to the survey was 36 minutes. So people, they sat there and they wrote what they felt like 55 people from this community answered with 36 minute answers on average."

**Data Analysis:** "We kind of looked at the word distribution, we aggregated those words into themes, and we found some common themes emerged."

**Kris Krüg's Promise:** "I'm gonna make that available online tomorrow on a public website."

### Community Platform Development
**David's Technical Build:** "We're building a platform for this group. And as Kris Krüg mentioned earlier, we're vetting each person to be a real person. So we all know who we are right now. We want to have a place online where that exists as well. We want that place to be private and something we control here in Canada, not a third party conglomerate somewhere else."

**Features:** 
- "We're gonna be building some experimental AI tools in there that people can contribute or try out"
- "In the next meetup we'll have a website with a directory"
- "The meetup after that will be an interactive portal where we can continue some of these discussions"

### Philosophy
**Kris Krüg's Vision:** "We're walking the walk here, we're trying to all come together, put the best of what we got in the middle and build something bigger than all of ourselves."

## Closing & Logistics

### Venue Care
**Kris Krüg's Emphasis:** "When we first came here, they didn't let us eat or drink in here, but because we are so respectful and we've been here nine months in a row, we get to do whatever we want around here and it's because we clean the fuck up and keep it nice."

**Community Responsibility:** "I told them we'd leave no trace. Would you guys help me?"
