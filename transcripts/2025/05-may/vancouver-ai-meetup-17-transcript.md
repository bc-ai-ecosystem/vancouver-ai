## Opening Remarks
**Host:** [[Kris Krüg]]

A Web Summit edition. How many of you have been to Web Summit in the last couple days? The energy this morning there was off the chain. You guys know that I'm very critical of government and mainstream hype and a lot of things as it relates to funding around AI, NBC and the stuff. But man, today was awesome and I really can see their vision.

It brought a lot of interesting people into our world. And one of the things we're gonna do here tonight is invite some of our people from this community who are on the trade show floor with their startup to just come get like a one minute, here's what the heck is going on out there at Web Summit.

So those of you who haven't been able to participate, especially as an insider, we'll get a look at what's been going on. I've been running around a bit. I'm even catching my breath here. Hopefully you got some food. I pulled the cooler into the back because we have a 90 minute program, so I wanna make sure you get a drink.

There's cans of bubbly rosé and beer in the back. There'll be dessert brought out after this at 10 o'clock when I kick you out at what seemed like an abrupt moment. They keep the planetarium with the telescopes open until midnight and they have an astronomer. They stay till midnight to show us the stars.

And this is the first time in three months we can see the sky. So at 10, at 10:05, you'll find me in the observatory. And now with his honor I like to start this off by getting everyone on the same page by inviting my friend Gabriel Georgian from Tsleil-Waututh Nation to welcome us onto this land and just open up with whatever he feels like. It's often a song as it words.

But it's been a real pleasure to get to know Gabe and his family through the process of putting these things on. Really happy for all the things you're going through right now that you can be here tonight and stuff, and I'll let you talk first and might say a couple at the end.

## Indigenous Welcome & Territory Acknowledgment  
**Speaker:** Gabriel George (Tsleil-Waututh Nation)

Hák, I'm part of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, but I have ancestry. I'm registered in Tsleil-Waututh, have a number there. The reserve I live on has a number as well. The village that I live in is called [indigenous place name], which is in North Vancouver. It means the bay at the base of a mountain, and I'm registered there as Tsleil-Waututh. But I have Squamish ancestry, I have [other nation] ancestry, and I'm here today to celebrate this evening with my good friend Kris, and all of you good people.

My great grandmother lived here. And when the [colonizers] came here and forced our Tsleil-Waututh people or indigenous people out of here, they put their stuff on barges, made them leave this village. She went back to where I live now with what's known in English as the Burrard Inlet Indian Reserve, number three.

And so that's some of the history that happened here. Prior to first contact, even 20 years before or more, my people were devastated. We went from like 10 to 12,000 people down to a few dozen people through diseases that came from Europe through the indigenous populations by way of Mexico in those areas.

And so in my family, we've suffered a lot of loss, a lot of death, a lot of abuse. My father attended residential school, my grandfather attended residential school, and there's a lot of suffering and when I have this chance, I try to talk a little bit about that. I didn't grow up hearing [indigenous language], I didn't hear any of that.

And even now, [indigenous languages] from Langley down to Tsleil-Waututh, over to where we are in Tsleil-Waututh and all those villages in between, there's, that's probably about 10,000 Coast Salish people. There's only about four of us that speak it, and there are no fluent speakers. And so we're still rebuilding ourselves, we're still getting stronger.

We're returning a lot of things. My relatives from [other nation], their reserve is here and they're doing those developments. They're building prosperity for their future. And I'm here today just to share a little bit. I didn't know much about AI to be honest. And I think it was maybe a few months back or longer, actually, I think Kris was persistent with me.

He was bugging me for a while before I came, I don't know if bugging is the right word, but he was persistent. And but in the last few weeks he showed me AI and it's helped me to organize things, organize a lot of different thoughts that I've had, a lot of different things. Right now I'm running for council within my nation and I've used some of that to help organize my thoughts around my campaign.

So I'm just starting to understand it and the way that our indigenous people do anything. Like I have a background in education. I went to the master's level, but I also learned from my elders and I put a lot more value in that because they had a way of being that goes back thousands of years and helped them to endure and survive many things.

And so I put high value in that. I'm the director of our treaty, lands and resources department, as it says here, which oversees our rights and title. In Canada, people are required to consult indigenous people on their lands. People that have not ceded or sold their lands, and not many of our Coast Salish people have done that.

And so we have over 600 proponents, active files that we deal with. Everything from environmental protection to protection of our intangible cultural heritage to archaeological remains and on. So it is work that I value and treasure, but in navigating that, I always lean back to our old people's way of thinking to the teachings, the history, the laws, the indigenous laws that I learned, and it's always guided me.

In a good way. And so that's my message here today as well, is, and there's a lot of ethics and there's a lot of... and also the idea that it's important we connect to one another. And so I think it's important in any work that we do, that we have that sense of community, that sense of family, and that we do things in an ethical way and in a sound way, in a good way.

And I think that although it can be challenging for indigenous people, for people that carry knowledge, I think it's good to seek those people out in the work that you do and bring those views into your work, into what you're doing, into the things that you organize. Kris was joking that I could go for an hour if I wanted, but I'm not gonna, I'll stop there.

I feel like I could keep talking, but I want to sing this song of thanksgiving.

[Song performed]

I just want to share a little bit more about the diversity of Canada and pre-colonial times. There was over, there was about 52 indigenous languages probably more really? 'cause some of them aren't recognized even today. One of my cousins on the island just got his language recognized not that long ago.

And half of those languages are in British Columbia. And so a very diverse, different systems of economy, systems of praying, systems of government, systems of medicine, on and on. And from Alaska down into to Northern California, there was a language that we used called Chinook Wawa. It was a trading language.

And so that was like our immediate market. But my late grandmother, great-grandmother said, our people with traveling canoes sometimes 10 or 12 years trading on the Pacific, or they would go over the Canadian Rockies and travel throughout Turtle Island, exchanging, trading. And so there was a vast wealth that was here in pre-colonial times and that was taken away.

And it's something that is coming back now, something that our people are leading. And there's a speaker coming up next who I'm a big fan of who's gonna talk a lot more about these things, but I just wanted to touch on some of that and give thanks to be here tonight with all of you. Thank you, Kris.

### Commentary on Gabriel's AI Usage
**Kris:** Gabriel is a very humble and strong poet warrior. He didn't tell you, but he's running for his nation's council. He's been nominated before we decided now is the time, and that's when he reached out to me and was like, this AI stuff we keep talking about, I think there might be something there as this thing I'm going through, and so he invited me to come over and to sit with him. 

We were making a bunch of recordings and stuff and as those of you've been through my courses or check me out I'm all about trying to make AI that think like us and sound like us and embody us and do the work that we need done and stuff.

And so we've been recording some stuff. We've been transcribing and using AI, we've been building a Notion knowledge base. We built a custom GPT that kind of writes some things like him and we've been using it. On Monday night or Tuesday night you had the youth question and answer to all candidates meeting and we spent a lot of time, asking questions to the thing, updating our scripts, and just like thinking about what you really have to say and changing the AI's perspective on it. We changed the six pillars to, from pillars to house posts and all sorts of interesting things. 

So thanks man for inviting me in to do this work with you. It feels so good and I hope it all goes great for you. And yeah man, thanks for sharing your ride.

## Community Announcements & Web Summit Participants

### Alright, so community announcement section. You guys who are coming up here know you've got one minute to talk. Would someone run my phone to me from that little sanitation station? It's on the foot of it right there or whatever. I'm gonna take a little call on Audible though. Your father's coming up next.

One of the cool things about Web Summit is it gives us this good excuse to bring all ourselves together and to really put off the welcome wagon, right? And so our good buddy who's a part of this community invited his father over and his father is a CEO of a $500 million Indian shoe company that makes these AI powered sensor shoes that connect via Bluetooth to your phone.

And so he runs an R&D lab for products and sensors around AI. Please come here, sir. I picked him up the other day at the airport and we've had him in meetings since then. And I know you've felt more strong other times, but I appreciate you being here. I want you to go next 'cause I want you to be able to take some rest.

It's been such a pleasure hanging out with you and with your son, and you're just welcome to take five minutes, tell people who you are, what you're about and why you're here. Thank you much. Thank you very much.

### VPO Zel - CEO, Vata Footwear & Impacto R&D Lab

I'll tell you something about this particular thing. Kris, I'm really grateful to you. You made my life so comfortable last two days, and let me tell you what it, when I landed from India, it was a 70 hour flight, another three hours and three hours prior to that. This entire thing was made so comfortable.

When you were waiting for me at the airport, you took me out for the breakfast, and I can tell you also, Rosa, I'm telling you, that was as most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Yes, I show you that, and that transcends the boundary of our nations. That's the feeling I had always, that I always felt art is one.

There's nothing like nations and all that. That's how it is. So I'm actually here to tell you something about a thought. This is as you are wearing a shoe, it's got a soul and there is a soul here. So I connect soul to soul. That's what I'm thinking about it. We might be manufacturing world's best, high tech footwears.

We have embedded massagers and all kind of [technology] you can think of. Your cousin come to you, you say you want to go to Costco and you do not know how to go. You just speak into it and tell her or him to go there and they just reach out there. Okay? Or you are a biker, you are on a bike. You want to go in the countryside, you put out the GPS locations and the thing goes and takes you there.

So these are all the things, but no, I'm not here to talk about the tech. It's things beyond tech. It's about empathy and emotions which are contributing out of the products. I tell you about one incident. I was sitting in my office, my state head comes in, he says, see, we are doing something really remarkable.

Come along with us to tier two, tier three places. Frankly, there are in India, they are very dusty and not very comfortable to be there. So I was trying to resist it, but he was pushing on me very hard. So I had to relent as I had to go with him. Now we are passing off. It's around 8:30, 9 in the night and it's all forest area.

Big boards out there stating that, please stay safe, drive safe. You have big elephants out here. You might be having tigers also. It is like next. So I was like, what is this where you brought me? Now the vehicle stops on the main road, is pitch dark all around. He said, I asked them, what is this?

Say, see there around 150 meters from here in the pasture. You see a five story building. I said, yeah, and when I saw it, it was illuminating, fully decorated, like anything. Then I was made to walk through that grassland. As I reached there, there were 15, 17 members of the family standing out there greeting me as I go inside.

I was shocked. It was one of the most beautiful stores they had built on their own, and every article placed so neat and clean, and that meant they were cleaning all the products themselves every day and taking care of it in a very immaculate manner. Every floor I went, it was better than the other floors.

So I just thought of asking them, what are you doing out here? 'cause you could have just had a warehouse and been selling all this. Then he told me a story. He said, we are the third generation. My grandfather was doing it, my father was doing it. I'm doing it. And this is our heart. This is what we are attached to.

I said, we are not there in every category. Possibly you could have been doing some other brands also. He said, not ever because we are not attached to the revenue only it's in our blood. And even if at any time, if I think about doing it, my 14, 15 members of the family will never, ever do. I was like, what is this in the world of profit?

What are they trying to do? It was supposed to be that I had to return the same in the morning, early morning, but then I was shocked. I said, no, I want to see what is happening rest of the places. So I said, take me to the retailer who are directly linked to this distributor. In the morning, they took me to one of the retailer.

I was there and they told me to stand at the counter and see what is happening. The first customer comes in, he says, I want this. He says, okay, take this. He says, do you have anything more? He puts up one more and says, this belongs to this brand. Why are you even thinking about it? He says, perfectly. Okay.

Within one and a half minutes, he goes away and next one comes. This thing keeps on repeating 11 or 12 times. Then I ask this guy, what is this? This guy tells me that this brand is in their head, in their body, and this contributes to their life. Through this experience, I understood that whatever we talk about revenue, of course revenue is important, but.

That connectivity in every sphere of life is very important. When you do things you might, like in my company, we have got solar power generation. We do all kind of water harvesting. We are doing, we don't we in fact using coffee waste in our soils. Okay? So we pick it from the different points and do it.

We don't throw garbage, plastic waste. We actually utilize it, recycle it, and utilize it. But whatever connectivity we have with our people, like the barometer of success in my company would be something like that. If I have 5,000 people, then within few years we should have 10,000. This is our barometer of success rather than talking only about the revenue thing.

So I'm really grateful to you for giving me this chance because this empathy and this community building system is what we are also taking care of out there. We are also taking care of number of our employees and definitely making sure that every part of the buildup is doing.

Even we have all kind of people like Ernst & Young, PWC, KPMG and Deloitte onboard, but that is only to generate energy among our people rather than doing anything else. And beside that, we have a thought process that every member should be contributing. So if any member expires in a family, then any next generation would be given a job in that manner.

We make sure something like that happens. And a lot of times you have to compromise in a lot of manners, but empathy and this coordination what you are trying to generate, Kris, lot of power to you. Please take care of it. Thank you very much.

### Kris's Commentary on VPO
**Kris:** Please come back. Please come back for one second. I just want to say this man's name is VPO Zel. His company is called Vata and his R&D lab is called Impacto. And so like yesterday we met with Misty West, Lee Christie, who's like pretty much the head of AI hardware type packing in Vancouver in terms of a commercial company.

And they really got down to the business. Lee could immediately see what was going on in the opportunities and stuff. And so if you're into putting sensors and stuff and you need to manufacture them at a scale beyond the 3D printer, DIY prototype, if you actually have some success and want them to go into production, talk to VPO, this kid's amazing and this is where he comes from.

And I really am thankful that you're here. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

## Web Summit Startup Showcase

### Next I believe is Ted. I hope yeah, let's see. You're doing more community announcements? Yeah. Oh, okay. It's still community announcements. Yeah I'll just put the [presentation] front. Sorry. But yeah, if we could go to my bad. I think Ted something. This one? Yeah. Okay. 

So what's up Rob? You could have got dressed. The point here is the next four or five people who are gonna come here and talk for one minute, or possibly two, but probably one is people from our community who are in the startup program.

So these guys have been exhibiting on the trade show floor. They've got booths and signs and swag and the rest, and they're out there trying to send their message to the world. So I thought, who better to tell us what's actually going on at Web Summit than the people on the floor.

### Startup Presenter #1: Rob's Company

I appreciate it, Kris. So like everyone else, shout out to Kris. I think the community itself speaks for itself. The amount of people that came all the way through downtown. Oh, sorry. Yeah. All right. Yeah, the amount of people that brave through downtown traffic, cross the bridge and come here to McMillan to support this awesome BC AI community.

This is amazing to see everyone here today. So as Kris mentioned, I was on the floor, so I'm gonna tell you a bit about Audible today as well. I was gonna present a little bit about the framework that we're building on our app, but there'll be other opportunities for that. Today has been super, super exciting on the floor.

So we had the chance to exhibit our app, and honestly, we did not expect to be so busy. I'm a veteran in the conference scene. Attended trade shows in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, San Francisco, you name it. And so I didn't know what to expect with Web Summit coming into town.

There's Web Summits all across the world. This is the first one we have in Vancouver. So what I experienced is that people want to learn. People really are curious about what's happening in the tech scene. So of course, 80, 90% of people or companies are saying that they're building with AI.

And so it's really up to us to be able to articulate and explain what makes us special. And so AI fascinates everyone. And one of the feedback that I gave to VC AI when Kris sent up the survey is what is it that's gonna make Vancouver stand out as an AI community across the world?

It starts with us, right? It starts with community, it starts with empathy. It starts with us helping each other, boosting each other. And what I saw today was, not everyone is in the same industry that I am. Not everyone is doing things that's related to what I'm doing. But as long as you know you're open-minded I want to share my experiences conceptualizing the product, building the AI frameworks that we're building our experiences, shipping the product, the obstacles that we've overcome, what works, what doesn't.

We realize that we're going to share, people are going to share as well. And so many people who are actively said that, oh, you know what? I might not be a target user, but I know someone that is. Let me introduce you to that person. And that honestly has been the best feedback that I've gotten.

And I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest of the week as an attendee. So I'll make the rounds on the floor if you're around. Please give me a shout out. But otherwise I think this has been a great experience and I look forward to seeing what the outcome is after this week.

So thanks a lot, Kris.

**Kris:** Thanks, Sam. His company's called [company name], he'll be demoing here again in the future, but you can check him out on his website. He's got some stuff online.

### [[Dean Shev]] - Virtual Health Technology

Let's go, Dean. Let's go Dean. And then let's, actually all y'all come up here who are talking during this part. Please. You know who you are.

All right. [[Dean Shev]] Virtual Health Technology. Thank you Kris. Thank you everyone. Thank you for having me. Let's, we're here. I do expect that I'll be speaking tonight, but thank you for having me. This was an amazing experience right now happening at Web Summit. So since I have only a minute I'm just gonna be very brief about what we found for the past two days.

There's still two more days to come and we're demo. We have a demo on Friday, so our booth is coming up live and for the first time to public, we are showing the demo of our product, which is going to blow your mind because so far when we're showing it to individuals today and yesterday, really it was amazing.

You showed it to people and they like it. They fall off their chair. Congratulations. So come take a look and be excited. You've all been hunkered down thinking of shit and build this shit, and you built it and demo today and people like it. People were like it, people were excited. I want you to come and take a look at it for yourself.

What is it? It is Edna. It is her. It's your AI. It's AI that knows everything about your health, everything, your vital signs, your past history, your family history, your DNA, your secrets beyond belief. Did they get it from my shoes? They can get it from every device you have connected to your cell phone.

And here's the secret of why everyone's just being knocked off the floor. Imagine any situation, any question you have about yourself and health. So today, for example, you go in the store and you wanna buy a product, a supplement, and you say, oh, should I have this supplement? And now what Edna says. No.

Why? 'cause you have this allergy, this history, this, and when people are like, wait a second, maybe this is a good thing that we have someone giving us advice. As simple as that, wait a second. Stop there for a moment. Reconsider your ideas because hey, maybe genetically, historically, based on your medical profile, it's not a good product.

Of course, things go even more intense. I'm not gonna go in detail.

**Kris's Interruption:** You know why this thing runs long sometimes is because this turns into a bit of a [discussion], so don't you know that half those people are still hung up on the first thing you said when you're like, "it fucking knows everything about you, about your health, about your insides." And so as a picture of this thing, like you gotta know that these people are like, why do I even fucking want that? How did the information get there? You know what I mean?

But here's the caveat. Nobody else will be able to have access to this data unless you have a telehealth care conversation with a physician and you allow it. So first time in the world, suddenly you can talk to specialists across the country that you need, and with a fingertip he has, or she has access to your medical data with Edna. 

Now, some people will say, whoa, why? Most people will say, oh my God, finally, because the decision ability for doctor to diagnose you just went a hundred times [better].

**Kris:** I think you're right. I actually think you're right about that. If you can get around the initial like, how the fuck does this thing know about me? What does it know? How, who's in control of that info? Once you can get past that hump, then the optimism, the power of what that could mean. Like I got a 25-year-old autistic son who barely speaks.

And his mother's a saint. She keeps a 3000 page medical history about him that she interprets to every new specialist, every new doctor. And she, if it were not for her completely full-time, dedicating her life to his care, he... and it's, but if he had this and that 25 page, 2,500 page health record of every seizure, every hospitalization, every surgery or whatever, could be deployable to a new doctor and a specialist that comes around when you need that person, it would completely change both of those people's lives.

So anyway, man, congratulations on launch day. Thanks for letting me bust your chops a little.

**Dean:** Don't worry. I won't do the same to you.

### Manufacturing AI Startup - Neils & Josh

**Kris:** I'm looking for James and yeah if you're talking he, his father. Oh, okay. He's very popular today. But I'm gonna tell you a story about him though actually, because come on.

In January of this year, I decided to start a startup. But I didn't know what I was building and I didn't want to build a product that nobody would use. 'cause I've done that in the past. And so instead, the approach was, I'm gonna find a really hard problem that somebody has that needs solving and use AI to solve it.

And so five days into starting my company, I registered for the BC [event]. I decided the coffee shop with [Josh] and he said, Neils I'm looking for a mission. And I was like, I have a mission. We're finding a problem, but I've got barely any money. And if I hire you, then run rate is gonna be half.

But I'll hire you anyway and we're gonna go find a problem. You're gonna start a company and we're going to do that. So we have since done that. Little did I know I would get a mini CEO along with the ride. So he's been there every single step of the way. And yeah our startup is focused on doing manufacturing AI for manufacturing.

We're starting in demand planning. We've done a pilot, they signed on for phase two. We're looking at our second customer right now. Manufacturing, they are struggling with lots of problems. The big thing is in Canada, we're actually one of the lowest productivity GDP per employee in manufacturing in the G7, half the productivity of the manufacturers in the US.

So when we're talking about the scale of the problem, there's so much to be done in operations, in terms of efficiency, in terms of being able to produce products better, quicker. And Canada has all the resources. So our company is really focused on enabling that here in Canada. Thank you.

**Josh:** I've been with Neils and it has been an amazing journey there. This guy works super hard day and night from 3:00 AM to 3:00 AM 24 hours, and that's how we get our pilots delivered in six weeks which take bigger consultancies three years. That's that part of it. And with AI and with the automations. I think I'll take another perspective at it.

Right now, we all need to integrate it into our lives, something which Kris and some of us are doing, and I'll give you a quick hack. So I have this Plaud device on my hand. It is recording everything I'm saying and everything you guys are saying to me. But this goes directly into my database, which could be anything.

It's in Notion database right now. It segregates information on different bases. And so eventually I have an entire database of proprietary knowledge that I own and as a company that we own manufacturing specific knowledge when we go to our consultations. I think that's something you guys, everyone should think on.

And Patrick is somebody who's doing great work everywhere and he, I think, yeah. But yeah let's make amazing AI products and integrate well into our lives and use it well as a good resource. Thanks guys.

**Kris's Commentary:** Thanks Josh. Stay here for a second though. I just got 15 text messages that says next month, people who are wearing those devices have to have a different color name tag so that we all know who's wearing it and who's not.

I'm obviously joking, but it's like a very popular product. Plaud fits right with my whole methodology around AI, which is create personal knowledge base from your head and your heart by speaking those words into the world. Never sit down in front of a dumb AI that you haven't fed this kind of shit to, that knows what you care about, who you are, what you think about, and stuff like that.

And through these devices, we can create these knowledge bases and stuff, and so they're really badass. I wanna give this guy one more shout out. In the last month, due to the thriving emergent nature of this community, I've registered a nonprofit and started the BC AI industry Association, and we'll talk about that.

Thank you. My life's busy and Josh has been very helpful along the way in many ways, and I really appreciate your support and stuff. You've gone above and beyond man, and this is a smart kid. I'm so happy he's found a great home with you. Thanks for bringing your father around and you add a lot to [the community]. Thanks guys.

### Unity Platform - James McKenzie

**James McKenzie:** I have to come here for a second. You guys remember when James didn't show up the month after he got married? This is the James that got married in Florida in January, and Brittany and I went down to his wedding. So congratulations, bro.

Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, do you mind if I take 30 seconds to talk about community? I know I have one minute, but. You can use your time however you want. I, no, because, okay, so I feel very similar to you, Dean. I am also working with Darren. He was supposed to pitch, I was told I think four hours ago maybe, that I was pitching.

Can you please talk about Unity? Okay. Awesome.

Okay. I came to this event the first time, the first event. It was I think I was in December. I had just met Kris a little while before. This was a while ago. And I said to Kris, I've noticed you posted like a whole bunch of events one month after, one month after one month or recurring thing.

Are they worth going to? What's the deal? And he said to me, they're worth going to James. And I said, okay, sounds good. I will. I pulled out my phone and Kris pulled up his phone too, and I thought that was kinda the end of the discussion. And I had purchased a ticket and he just turned over to me and said, here's your discount code.

I said, sorry, but I already bought the ticket. You said it was good. I wanna be there. And the experience I got coming to that, it was a different venue, but it felt kinda the same. To me the first experience was the blue lights, the purple lights, the everything. I walked in and I felt like I had walked outta Vancouver and into San Francisco.

And that's how I felt. That's really how I felt at the time. But actually I was wrong, totally wrong, entirely and completely wrong because I didn't walk out of Vancouver into San Francisco because I walked out of what I thought Vancouver was into what Vancouver could be.

**Kris:** And I feel like I really appreciate all of the things you've done, Kris, for the AI community and otherwise, I'm sure everyone's gonna say that, so we can skip that part. Listen, I don't need the thanks. I'm happy you guys respond to the call. I believe in the intrinsic power of community.

So by forming interconnections amongst ourselves, we can go after shit that's bigger than any of us. So I appreciate the gratitude, but it's really about you guys.

**James:** Absolutely. Yeah. No, I think it's fantastic that we're building a community here in Vancouver that focuses on AI and focuses on this sort of amazing sort of democratization of AI as well as its use cases. Its real use cases, and not this AI that's chained up in some basement.

Sorry I could go on for hours, but I'm sure Kush could go on for like days. All that to say is real quick before I go to [demo] and I will is that I am also demoing with Tendai over there. He's waving now.

There was a little show. I think we'll probably be doing it again after this wraps up Tendai. We'll get you up here next month, bro. Yep. Awesome. So what that is you can talk to Tendai. He's got a demo. I don't need to talk about it. It's, I'm not the salesperson. I don't know why Darren put me here.

Okay, perfect. Okay. And then another real quick notice you can talk to Paul if you're non-technical. Paul, raise your hand. You've got a cool hat. If you're non-technical and you really like audio talk to him. That's all I can say. I can't talk more. Okay.

### Biz.er Platform - Shane

**Shane:** That's Biz.er. What is Biz.er? Biz.er is a platform for connecting people with businesses they want to buy or businesses they want to sell. The way it is right now is messed up. Darren had this whole pitch. He wrote a bit like crunchbase meets... some kinda thing. I disagree. I think he's right in one way. I think what Biz.er is, it's like perplexity in that sense is that you know what you want, you know what business you want to buy, you know what business you want to sell, but you don't know how to connect those two people.

And the platforms as they are, the realtors, as they are, the brokers as they are. They don't... they're old school, you tell 'em about a fax machine and they're like, oh, crazy. So we are living in a world where people are disconnected from technology and they're trying to connect businesses, trying to sell businesses through the old school way and the old school way.

And what Biz.er is it connects people with companies they want to buy, tailored to what their interests are, what they have, the ability to buy and connects sellers of businesses to who's actually interested in selling rather than the people trying to waste their time.

That's basically it. Darren would've sold this far better than I could, but he's not here, so it's his fault.

**Kris:** Shane awesome. I'm actually really happy after [unclear]. He's been here since the beginning. He's one of the OGs. He's working on a lot of our projects. He's a legit data scientist, machine learning engineer, AI guru, and also now a pitcher, apparently.

Good, good job pitching my friend. I got 14 businesses I wanna sell, so sign me up for an alpha.

## AI and Education Subgroup Launch

### **Kris:** One of the cool things I said is that out of this community, a whole bunch of other things that sprung up and so I've been very interested in the, obviously many of us are interested. I've talked to so many of you about education, our children future of education classrooms. Where is it going? How are people learning? Does it seem, does the old way seem mis-adapted towards the future? And what are we gonna do about it? 

And so [name] came to me and she said, Hey, I've been coming for a couple months and I've been watching and I feel connected to this place and I've got this idea. I'd like to start a subgroup around AI and education. And I'm like, thank God. 'cause I want that too. And I haven't been able to advance it along. 

And so then since we've connected, we've been able to put our heads together. She's taken the reins and built some stuff out in our Notion. And so we are officially launching the AI and education subgroup of the BC AI ecosystem.

### Professor Ia - University Canada West

Thank you for this. Thank you for being a spark, actually. And thank you for being a welcoming, warm community here. I'm happy to bring a slightly different voice tonight. I admire all those ed tech, big tech, mid tech, and all creative people here. So we're coming from the educators part.

I'm an associate professor of strategy at University Canada West, and I've been pursuing my second PhD in educational technology and learning design at Simon Fraser University studying UDL plus AI, which is inclusive education, and now how AI can help us to make it more inclusive, especially in the non-English context.

And thank you. Thank you. Patrick. [unclear] you, so I recognize your, I have AI built in.

So today I'm here to briefly announce, and academics love to talk, but I promise to be very brief after a long day at Web Summit. I think I'm running out of my battery already. Just to introduce a new kid on the BC AI or Vancouver AI block, which is EDU Educators plus AI.

And it's just a space for starting a real conversation how learning should be shaped here in BC and in the context of AI. Anybody interested is welcome. And I would like also to proudly thank our University Canada West, and please welcome our team. We'll be led by Vice President of Strategic Development, Mr. Kamil [surname] and the bunch of wonderful educators and ed technologists there. I promise I'll give you the mic back.

**Kris:** Yeah. Okay. I promise I'll give it back. I just want to have a visual demonstration of going viral for a sec. So while everyone who was here that was invited by Ia, please just stand up for a quick sec. Just a quick sec.

Perfect. So guys, we have a whole new node in our community brought on by Ia here, right? So the idea, she grabs it and embodies it, spreads it, advances it, and brings a whole new group of professors to explore AI and education. That's what going viral looks like. Thank you Ia.

**Ia:** Yeah. We're also planning to have our own meetup space at University Canada West. It's a fancy building. Where Vancouver House is under the bridge with a fancy chandelier, right? You know where it is. There is a chat, a group on WhatsApp as well. You are very welcome to join. It's free and hopefully we will turn it into something engaging and we hope to grow.

Thank you so much for being so welcome.

## Mind AI and Consciousness Group Update

### **Kris:** And one of the groups that we're talking about is my Mind AI and Consciousness. This is one of our first subgroups that formed, and this one is... if you end up doing as good a job as these guys have done, it will have been a good decision that we started this. So Mind AI and Consciousness has gotten together three times.

It's a deep group. Loki runs his shit different than I run my shit. It's not Lucy Goosey laid back. He starts at six. You better have done the reading. There will be a quiz.

### [[David Monteyne]] - Mind AI and Consciousness

Hey folks. Loki and [other names] and some other folks spontaneously created a group called Mind and Consciousness and AI. And we've met together a few times and it's still emergent what's really happening. But the gist is we have about 20 people coming together. There are readings and a topic, and it's usually about understanding something about mind and consciousness.

Does AI have a consciousness? What would it look like if it did? Could we develop a test to figure out if it was? What is free will? What the fuck would that mean? Anyway so we look at what's known and we try to apply it to AI and help understand what AI could do for us. But also, is AI a tool we can use to understand ourselves? Yes. Hell yes. It is unknown.

So every session we explore that, look at it from different point of view and a different subject. Everyone's welcome. There's a cap of 20 people, so if you want to join us. Let us know. It's at SFU Venture Labs and yeah, please do reach out once a month. Very good.

**Kris:** Thank you David. Thanks for picking up the tie dye t-shirt.

No, I got us a bunch of tie dye t-shirts made. They're one of a kind, they cost $100, I'm sorry, but that's how much they cost to make 'em custom hand. There's only like 10 of 'em out there on the rack, so if you want a custom hand dyed t-shirt. Thanks for picking it up today, David. I really appreciate it. 

David is also a technologist building community software and we have a WhatsApp channel and a lot of us are connecting there, but it's not, it's good. It brings us together, but it is not taking us all the way we want to go. We want to have deep threaded conversations with permalinks over time that really bring us closer together. 

So David's company builds on top of open source tools like WordPress and we've been putting our heads together for months now, and we are gonna move forward in the coming months with an expansion of the infrastructure for us to be able to share ideas and projects and stuff like that.

Thank you, David. I really appreciate it.

## AI Video Production Showcase

### **Kris:** Okay. Where are we at? We're close. Hackathon, I think. Next. Yeah, but there's BC AI and my little thing. Oh yes, of course. Hit it. Let's see what's next. It's you, isn't it? It is. All right. I'm stoked. Mr. Pixel Winner is a very close collaborator of mine.

[[Kevin Friel]] here. We've done all sorts of creative stuff together, but he just graduated from a 12 week AI filmmaking program for Hollywood type people. And right after that, the whole world of tools changed. Google dropped VO3, all sorts of stuff came up and Kevin's like I gotta learn that shit too.

So I ain't gonna talk for him too much, but I'll tell you, if you listen to his couple minutes, you get a two minute trailer as hot as they get straight out of the brand new brains of the baby AIs.

### [[Kevin Friel]] - Mr. Pixel Wizard

Yes. Howdy everyone. How's it going? My name's Kevin. I'm also known as the Pixel Wizard. So I've been in film and television for just, wow, this year is 25 years. I have incredible cream for my face if you're asking about how old I am, not just my face.

So I've been experimenting with the latest and greatest AI tools over the past year and a half. And as Kris mentioned, I just came out of a pretty elite 12 week program of how to get in with ComfyUI, playing around with some of the latest materials, how to run your own models locally, how to create your own workflows in storytelling, narratives in the most efficient way possible using what's there.

And I was literally one of 12 to 15 folks from around the world. A lot of really big names in the video AI space on LinkedIn right now, and we've all floated each other up. It's been an incredible ride. That is almost all bunk ever since Google VO3 came out. Just about, there's a lot of principles that are still involved.

So what I decided to do was get a sneaky little VPN connection to the US and get into VO3. Try it out. And this is what I've got cooking at the moment. Lights...

### AI-Generated Video Demonstration

**[Video plays]**

"Good evening. In all my years as an anchor, your anchor, I never thought this story would arrive. Tonight we stand at the threshold of a new chapter in human history, one that until now lived in whispers, shadows and speculation. Last night in a televised address, watched by billions, the president of the United States confirmed what many long believed.

Oh my God. Oh my God. We are not alone. I know this is totally fucked, but please frame up the guest camera one. The governments of the world have known and the coverup is over tonight. History is not just being made. It's sitting right beside us. For the first time ever, a being from beyond Earth has agreed to appear live and speak with humanity. Stay with us. The interview with the visitor begins right now."

**Kevin:** Yeah, I cooked that together in two and a half days of six hour sprints.

**Audience Question:** Can I just say one more? Yeah. Just, it's maybe funny. In the past you would've had to like, go find an alien, hire the alien, negotiate. But now with the power of AI, you can skip all those steps.

**Kevin:** It's true. If you thought union rates were bad, try and hire a union alien. It is out of this world. I'm so sorry for that joke. I'm stuck. You can punch me later. Yep. It's true. Kris will fight you. Yep. Yep.

So yeah, that's, as I mentioned, two and a half days, six hour sprints. VO3 is incredible. Most of those generations were within one to four generations before it really hit the mark. I used a custom GPT that's fine tuned for VO3 prompting to help me get my prompts into the field. That really helped considerably, although I've got a lot of prompting juice now from that course as well.

The last three shots in there in the newsroom studio, VO3 is not very good at consistency at the moment. So what I had to do was take... it's a different alien in every shot that it produced in a different set and a different newscaster, like everything. So what I had to do was use actually Runway, their new multi-reference tool. I took stills from what I generated in VO3 of my newscaster, my new set, and my alien when I was happy with them.

And I ran them through Runway to give me stills that were incredibly coherent through it, and I could prompt different shots out of that. And then take those and bring them over to Kling actually to animate those because it is very much still the high water mark for image to video workflows at the moment.

And also, the other marvel of VO3 as well is that it gives you audio at the same time as your video generations. That newscaster prompt was one generation and I was so in love with that performance. I wanted that voice again, but I couldn't get it to repeat. So what I did was I went to ElevenLabs.

Yes, there we go. I trained it on the eight seconds that I had, it likes 10. So I repeated it twice, trained it on that voice, and then I did a performance, 'cause I've done a little bit of news casting education in my day. Pretended to be a newscaster for a hot second and did a voice to voice performance.

And it sounds pretty coherent, right? Yeah, it's really cool to get to play with these sandboxes. And these new tools and to really spitball these ideas in ways that I never would've had access to, especially for $200, which is what my VO subscription was for this month. So thanks for the platform to show this off, Kris, and I'm really grateful for y'all.

Thank you.

**Audience Question:** How long would that take and how much would it have cost without AI?

**Kevin:** Oh, okay. Bro, sets and crews and lights and if I did it indie styles and I know a lot of visual effects artists. I actually worked on Dune part one, so I've got a lot of top caliber [artists] that are near and dear friends of mine, it's probably 100K if I was doing it on the cheap, and probably about three months. And if we gave your full price time for the last few days, including, but we're talking 10K.

**Audience:** 10K versus 100K.

**Kevin:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's pretty killer.

**Kris:** Kevin's leading a AI video and audio Hollywood quality AI generation class coming up in a month or two or something like that. But if you want Kevin's knowledge, he's got a way for you to tap into it.

## Surrey AI Community Update

### **Kris:** Okay. Is there anyone who I've already spoken to who's expecting to speak that will feel overlooked if I move on to the next section that I've forgotten about? Shout it out. Schwartzman, sir. Yeah. Come on bro.

One of the spinoff groups I called Mind AI and Consciousness, but it might be Surrey AI. Matthew came to Kevin and I and he was like, we love what's going on there. But a, the vibes changed a little bit when it went from your studio to here and that it's like a more formal program with the stage.

And he really liked, like everyone just hang out in a circle, and also it's far, bro, I can't always make it there by the certain time and I'm gonna bring this to my community. So I was like, I don't know. And Kevin's like yeah, let's go. Let's do it. And so he's held three events in Surrey now his family's gotten involved.

Riv is here somewhere. Alright, I'm just broken today. Yeah. Riv, I told you months ago to help but not push it. You're doing fine. You pushed it. I did indeed. You've been relieved of duty. Next month you're officially an observer. Thank you.

### [[Matthew Schwartzman]] & Riv - Surrey AI

**Matthew:** Yeah. So yeah, so the Surrey AI events, just like Kris said is a little too far. The first story I ever told was I was changing a clutch in my car and then realized I'm running late to this. And it was an hour drive away. So we started Surrey AI events with Riv. We love the vibes, but transitioning to fit more people, more eyes, it does lose some things, but it does gain a lot more.

So just losing that vibe aspect of a very close and tight community. Like our very first meetup, we had a circle where everybody went around, told a story about them working on AI and what AI tools they use. The light bulb moment or AI light bulb moment.

**Riv:** Exactly. My AI light bulb moment 15 seconds was in grade 12. I really hated English, so I might've made a custom GPT learning from Kris. So don't blame me, blame him. So I made a custom GPT, recorded all the English lectures and then all the books that we had to read, submitted it all, and then we had to answer some questions. So I took a photo of the questions, gave me the answers.

And then I barely graduated. So there you go. There's a story.

**Kris:** He looks like a truthful, honest guy. But he kinda threw me under the bus there and he didn't tell you the whole story. He actually used his GPT and then he hand wrote the answers out in cursive with a pen and turned them into the teacher so she couldn't run them through the GPT detector.

So who's the devious one? Ingenious one. Ingenious one.

We'll put these up later, but scan 'em now. Surrey AI, it's 30 bucks, then early bird discounts, half price. When you get there, Riv buys you whatever you want at the bar. Like they don't do catering. He says okay, let's go to the bar. We buy you some food. And then it's really cute.

## BC AI Industry Association & Community Infrastructure

### **Kris:** Vancouver AI, this is our next meetup. Yeah. Woo. A lot of people here. 50 of us are annual members. It's called Core membership. It just means you get cheap tickets every month, but you buy a year's worth of tickets. And it sustains us. It gives us runway. And when I go in there and talk to government people and I'm like, I have the backing of folks, they're like, how many folks?

And I tell 'em a number and they're like what does it mean to have your backs? So when I can say listen, we got 55 people signed up for the Core Annual membership program. They're like, huh, that they're looking for someone to help organize the community and to tell them what we need.

Actually, it's probably a good time for me to do that part. What? Thank you. Of course. Sorry, which one? Just keep going. I think it is gonna come next naturally. Yeah. Woo.

I had a whole presentation tonight that Sev helped me build. We launched this nonprofit a week and a half ago or so, and when we did it, we asked you guys to fill out some survey questions. 10 open-ended survey questions. They were all optional. You all spent 36 minutes on average filling out the survey. 55 people spend 36 minutes on average filling out the survey, telling us what they needed, what they wanted, and there were some patterns.

And I'm not even though I promised I was gonna present the data back to you guys tonight. I'm not going to. It's done. I'm sorry. Sev. I will give you 30 seconds to say what's in there if you want. I do want you to talk, but we're not gonna do that tonight because we don't have time. But thank you for responding. We've learned some stuff. I'll share with you, we built the website so you can go dig through the data.

Sev won the data storytelling hackathon that we're about to tell you about here. And we use his championship techniques to analyze your survey data, make some sense of it, put some visualizations around it, and I promise I'll share it with you soon. Just it would take me 10 minutes and you don't want that.

### Sponsor Acknowledgments

In the back. Is the cooler? You'd like to refresh your beverage? We're gonna thank our sponsors. [[Dimitri Schwartzman]] can't be here tonight. He's Matthew's father. He's Eliza's father, I don't see here, but he's a real estate agent who's tinkering with AI, big supporter of ours.

Also, I wanna say thank Segev Law firm. [[Ron Segev]] and [[Ron Segev]] are two lawyers with the specialization in the AI and crypto space. They give us money every month to keep the lights on. And then we got Sons of Vancouver, a distillery in North Van who gives us six bottles of vodka every month that we turn into a bunch of cosmos for you guys.

We've got [[Kevin Friel]], who, bro, I give him like 5% of what he's worth legitimately and thank you bro. Thank you for showing up. Thanks for being stoked. I had so much fun with [project] yesterday, making video blogs and stuff. That's awesome. I can't wait to see what we filmed at the Orpheum yesterday and we're both so excited.

We made some hot shit. Michelle Diamond can't be here, but she's one of the best photographers I know. Happy to have her as a sponsor. Victor. Victor, we did a podcast with you yesterday. I can't wait to share it with the world. This guy does documentary community spotlights with many of you.

We've released about 10 of them and we have two in the can. VPO's about to drop soon. Philippe Pasquay from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology. His document about to drop soon. I appreciate you. Then [[Mark Busse]] can just flash back one quick set. [[Mark Busse]], Meta Creation Lab, and the one at the bottom is my company.

I teach AI courses and stuff for creative professionals and other folks.

## Rival Technologies Hackathon

### **Kris:** Okay, moving right along. Okay, so we set Web Summit Startups. Now just keep going until you get to Sev's face. Has anyone seen Julia or Dale from Rival Tech? Okay. Yeah. Come on up. Sure this is the last of our announcements until we get into the two talks that we're gonna have.

Kush who's gonna talk about how AI works, and [[Carol Anne Hilton]] is gonna talk about her Indi Genomics AI platform for uncovering unaccounted for indigenous economic activity in Canada.

So we got our first hackathon out the door, Sev won, and we got our second one in the works. Tell us what's up, Julia?

### Julia - Rival Technologies

Yeah. Hi everyone. So if you weren't at the last couple of meetups my company, Rival Technologies, not my company, I work there we are sponsoring a data hackathon. So Rival is a market research platform company. We use a lot of AI to tell the story of data in our platform and we're looking for new ways to do that.

My boss, our CEO, the founder of Rival who's good friends with Kris as well, Andrew Reed, he's decided to sponsor this hackathon. We're doing four rounds. We've done one already. Sev, who I think is here won the last one. Really nice getting to know him. And some of the other [participants].

Yes, we're giving away $2,500 per round, so we're on round two now. We are essentially looking for people to come up with ways to creatively tell the story of data. So round one was a warmup. Round two is a little bit more intense. We did a survey with a thousand respondents from the Angus Reed Forum asking 'em all about Canadian identity.

It was I think quite timely with the election and things going on with the US and all of that. And we asked Canadians all about their opinions on what identity means to them, what they hope for the future of Canada, those kinds of questions. It's a pretty interesting data set and I think once you get your hands on it and if you're interested, you're gonna find there's some polarizing opinions in there. There's definitely a wide range of people from the political spectrum, but that's what you get when you reach out to the public of course.

And it's a, yeah, I think we're gonna see some really interesting [projects]. First one was really cool and there was some great projects. I'm super stoked to see what comes out of this next one. And yeah, in a month we'll be awarding the next prize, and I believe the deadline to submit is June 11th, and then we'll be announcing the winner at the meetup in a month.

Thank you.

### Kris's Commentary on Data Ethics

**Kris:** Yes, but not right now. Yeah. Several, hit me up. And it's on our website. It's on vancouver.bcai.net, which you can hit me up for later. I did wanna say one thing. It was about the data and it was about... so I was pretty naive thinking that we could just reach out to like Joe Canadian and ask 'em about like the future of what it meant to be Canadian at a time when Trump's trying to make us the 51st state.

And we're having all these elections and I was definitely naive. We got back a variety of pretty spicy responses. And this starts, one of the values that I get from this community is I haven't always done this before. I don't know how to release a data set into a group of people to do a hackathon like this, right?

I didn't even know what my legal obligations were as it related to this data set because there was hate speech in there. And I came to learn that I probably could have been charged with dissemination of hate speech, but I would've had a good defense as argued in 2012 by a university in Toronto about their dissemination of some research or whatever.

And that's led me and Kush and Brittany and Julia into this meta level discussion about how, what do we release? What do we take responsibility for? Should we censor any data? Proj, I think about you a lot of times, man, like your 16-year-old hacker who I want to be in this thing.

Do I wanna subject you to some weird dude's hate speech as a table stakes for you being able to participate in this hackathon. And I chose, no, I don't want to, right? And so we eliminated three responses, I believe from the whole thousand person data set. Kush has maybe convinced me that I shouldn't have done that.

And I think that's also valid. But I just wanna say that the ability to explore these higher level philosophical things around data and AI and stuff has been really enriching for me. And so I'm getting a lot out of this too, and I thank you guys for that. 

Check out the data, participate. Andrew took us out for a very expensive dinner. All the people who submitted a project and had their thing shortlisted, he took us out for a really fancy dinner. So even if you don't win, there's perks. Download the data at least and throw it into GPT and be like, what the fuck is in here anyway? And when that answer comes back, see if you're inspired and take the next step.

So that's where we're at.

## Technical Keynote: How AI Really Works
**Speaker:** Kush

### **Kris:** Okay, let's take a breath if you want a drink there in the back. Kush is coming up here to give a talk about how he thinks about AI. A lot of us think we know what AI is. We even talk about it as a person or a thing, but it's this whole series of processes and stuff. And so Kush, I welcome you up here with your laptop to take 10 minutes and blow our minds about AI and what's really going on with next token prediction and how much, what's going on under the hood.

Bro, I want you here... not as big as [presentation].

**Kush:** Open source, steering animals. I didn't need myself, right? By the way, since I have time, first debate of the evening, this is not me. This is Kris fuckery with AI, not me. Mostly that is not my hair, honestly. Beyond my hair, shoes, I don't see any shoes. Those are not my shoes. These are my shoes.

Lights. Yeah.

All right. Hello. My name is Kush. I'm a software engineer for the most part. Not that I'm allowed to be. I didn't study that. My background is film and visual effects and also industrial design. Designing furniture and stuff. Not that I've done that either, either professionally. I just learn things and then don't go into them as jobs, and somehow I survive. I'm not really sure how. Once in a while someone just comes around and usually like builds an app or something they build. Yeah. And then, that's how I survive.

So anyway, enough about me. That was the first slide about me. That I do a few things. So today I'm here to talk about what initially what I was talking about with Kris. A few of the things I wanted to explore. But one of them that later on was search and like how embeddings work, right?

But when I was talking about embeddings to Kris as well, I was thinking about how to explain that. I thought maybe I should go back into the history of search. How has it evolved? And I love the history lesson. I love when people give me a low down on how things went and when, what happened, et cetera.

But then as I was doing that and I was like, okay, search has come so far. I was like you know what? It still sucks. And that's not like an epiphany. I know. I watch it every single day. Fucking sucks. And so I was like, you know what? I think I have to also address that even with all this stuff, it still sucks.

So the talk's in two parts. First I'm gonna talk about the history of search, the evolution of it, and then I'm gonna talk about why it still sucks.

All right, so let's go into it. Evolution of search, big brand title.

All right. Initially let's say I have a data set, right? We have the data set of movies. I've just put 'em all here. Some of my, some of the movies that I've watched. [Lists movies] and they're like in three genres: comedy, action and sci-fi. And I'll look into in a moment we wanted to search something in this data set, right?

So let me also get out my phone so I have some sense of how much time I have so I can get you out of here as well as not go over it. So I want a data set. One of the ways that I could do is perhaps alphabetically sort it, then go, depending on the character Z or D or whatever, try and do that.

Find research in my mind. How did people figure out how to search items? In life reasons? So long time ago even 2000 BC I believe we had people cataloging in libraries, like library in Alexandria famously has scrolls categorized based on topics. So even back then, and certainly even in 1605 there's I think it's Francis Bacon or whatever it was, but there's explorations of taxonomies, et cetera.

And so manual classification one great way of trying to find content in a large catalog. Of course, right now I only have 25 movies or whatever, but you can imagine, three 5 million or something. Certainly Amazon products or whatever might be a billion possibly okay, so let's classify these things.

I've now classified them into my database in such a way that I have three different genres in which they are categorized as well as I have ability to sort. So that helps as well. If I wanted for the sort of oldest movies within the sci-fi categories that are in my library that I've purchased or something I can go ahead and see Matrix is in there.

Maybe I feel like watching that, maybe I feel like watching Home. I love Home. So possibly that, that's a good way to explore the data. This is some form of search. You're searching for information that you know you want, you may not know exactly what it is, but certainly you have some information coverage, right? Et cetera.

Okay. When time passes by, people realize oh, by the way, then of course the clustering or the categorization of these genres is still a bit too rigid. Sometimes we may not have a movie that's just a comedy. It might also be a comedy sci-fi, it might be something like that. So we can of course, do multiple [genres].

But some geometry. That idea I also, another vector, which is themes. So themes can apply [to] multiple movies. A movie can have multiple themes. So let's say if I look for movies about greed, we see Parasite in there, we see The Big Short in there. These are not perfect labels, by the way. Don't come after me. I just kinda put it together, however, just for the purpose of the example.

And okay greed. We have two movies. Let's say greed and finance, probably The Big Short, right? Let's say greed and systemic failure. Also The Big Short. Perhaps if people [search] inequality, maybe Parasite comes up. That's the movie classification in the database. So that helped search classification, but a bit more deeper classification/topic.

Then, let's say jump past 2000, 3000 years, we get computers. We can now do digital searches, we can do exact string matching. I know the name. And even though database is 20, 50 million entries, I could find it very easily. May take the computer a few days to figure it out.

Okay, so string matching. Let's say I wanna look for a movie that is talking about shooting. Is there a movie like that? Sorry, shooting. There's maybe guns involved, maybe there is revenge involved. Okay. Revenge, Kill Bill, John Wick if possible. Sure.

What you saw as I was typing, I was trying to type a type of word, but it wasn't quite working. And misspellings were not factored in. So if I say revenge, it doesn't really work, but this is pretty odd. Like it's a computer, it should be able to figure it out. Something as simple as that. And certainly for a while this was the norm, but even as far back as sixties, in fact, a lot of stuff in the sixties computers wise, the idea of edit distance gets introduced, which is called Levenshtein Distance by Levenshtein.

And then the idea there is you can make typos. 'cause people of course start typing searches on computers. And this problem is now more prevalent than ever. And so now you can say, if I'm looking for, let's say, intention. Intention, okay, even though I made a mistake in typing, I can see that it still matched it, right?

It didn't just say, or if I say attention, let's say whatever. So the idea is now you're able to make some errors. The UX is much more friendly. And you get to access information that you may even have a misunderstanding about the spelling or simply may mistake your typing or perhaps much more common, the dataset itself, the product, you may, someone may have made an entry that is incorrectly entered. So over time then people are like, okay this is great. We can combine different elements together.

So Boolean search comes around at the same time, '65, '75. And the idea there is, okay, I'm gonna give you multiple pieces of information about the thing that I'm looking for. And I want you to find the exact specific thing that I have in mind. So this might be this thing AND that thing. If it matches both. And that's my criteria. So I'm gonna say I'm looking for a movie that is dark. Okay, I see two, two options. Arrival, Network. Actually I'm looking for something that is dark comedy.

Oh, Network. Network works, right? So now you have two different vectors that you've applied or two different pieces of information that you're using together. You could of course do NOT, I want this, that is NOT that, hey, I put this holding three days, so excuse me for not building that in.

So alright, moving forward from that we then get people doing all this stuff and finding it still is making us look for exactly information. And unless we know the data, unless we know what values are there, what genres are there, what names are in there, and what descriptions might contain the words.

If you don't have the exact word, let's say there's a word called "doable" in here. But if we say "world." What word is lost? It doesn't matter. We won't really find exactly the thing if the word isn't there, the data set. So people start to figure out what are ways in which we could go beyond just the exact keyword matching.

And by the way, they made a lot of products on the keyword matching stuff. They, there's an algorithm called TF-IDF, which is an effort to say, Hey, if there's certain words that are represented in a given description more often than not, and if they're also common everywhere else, "the", "and" and so on, ignore them. The words that aren't too common, prioritize them. And this way you can really search large data sets much faster than having to literally string match one by one. Constant search time go faster.

But even with all that stuff, and BM25, another algorithm, evolution of TF-IDF, people couldn't get quite past the feeling that we could have a better mapping of words, sentences, et cetera. That's when semantic search comes in and embed functionality and little bit of visualization to show you how they work as well.

But first demonstration, see you said, right? But now I can say, you know what I'm looking for... shit, I think of examples. I forgot all the examples I had in my... let's say a movie about, I don't know, some guy on Wall Street making a lot of money.

Okay? I hit it. It did not do a good job. This engine is not very good. Forgive me for that. Let's say, I don't know, identity crisis. Now, it doesn't really show... Okay? This holding the joke doesn't matter. The thing works. [Unclear] as well. I that I, I don't have that information in this data set, but let's say a movie with a time loop where aliens invade and there's a big war going on.

Yeah. What the fuck's going on, wizard. It doesn't matter. Something must certainly have gone wrong 'cause it wasn't this bad before. The point is semantic search will match you the thing that you're looking for, even if the words don't appear in the items themselves, pretty common aspect. You do have, you have seen, experienced this stuff now in the, especially in the last few years.

Something that I wanna mention though, why am I talking about this stuff? Maybe I'll go into it later. 'cause then I'll give [presentation] so embed, how does this semantic search actually work? What's happening, the way it is able to match meaning to something that is the same meaning but differently worded, is using an embedding model.

An embedding model is like one of those language model language models. It's something similar. It's a neural network and it's trained. There's two steps to it. One is a BERT step, the other is contrastive learning and so on. But the idea is you train a model to be able to first understand language to an extent so that you can just say, generally this means that, or this thing is closer to that.

And then you train it to say, this concept and that concept are similar. And now fine tune your weights, fine tune yourself so that whenever I give you this string, you put it in a point in space. For now, we imagining a two dimensional space. Generally is 3D, 4D, 5D, actually 1000 dimensions. But that means that now I have a function, now I have ability to take any concept, any string, any paragraph, any large piece of text and make a address out of it, make a location in space.

And that happens to be the first time I learned about it. And I still don't understand the math of most things. I was like, how the fuck does this work? Like how can actually a model put two concepts that mean similar things in a similar point in space? This model is frozen. It's not learning anymore. It's learned and it's done. It's just ready for you to use. Always frozen in time. Somehow for this model, if I put the description, a darkly comedic thriller, plus sci-fi, the Parasite one, it shows up there. But then if I put in Fight Club, it shows up something close to it. If I put as the description of Moon the movie, somehow it seems to be much farther away. If I put a description of Die Hard. It seems far away from Parasite and Fight Club and also far away from this.

So it's interesting that's able to map out. Now this is lacking a little bit in information about what have we really trusted. So I went ahead and actually added colors to this based on the actual raw genres that we already know.

So now you're able to kinda see, oh, you know what? There seems to be already a cluster. The model already seems to have clustered all the dark comedies somewhere on the left. All the action films somewhere together on the right and all the sci-fi ones somewhere over here. Now it's very hard to get this chart to look right 'cause I'm using something called PCA as a way to reduce the complexity of what this really is.

From a thousand dimensions into something that eyes can understand and brains can process. But certainly now you can really understand that this model is quite good at placing meaning into point in space. So anyway we get to semantic search. We are able to now, for example, I used to do something fun, but I'm totally backing out on all these examples.

But let me give someone, give me a description of a movie, which "first interview of an alien." "First interview of an alien." All it showed up in the sci-fi area, right? So these are all sci-fi movies. Event Horizon, Arrival, right? Let's say oh shit, I should, whatever, doesn't matter. Let's pick another one.

I know. Yeah. Let's say "man goes around killing people for fun." Yeah. Yeah. I don't really... I had all these, okay. Ethics battle I don't know. Cool stuff is happening. It is also in the sci cluster, action as well.

Wow. I'm really like forgetting all the examples. Never mind, it doesn't matter. But you get that. It is somehow approximately putting this new string that I have in mind into a point in space. Now, how could you use it? "Poem about the brain of an artist." "Movie about the brain of an artist?"

Okay, this is quite ambiguous. It could be somewhere between this, and this. So I guess it's good enough, like ambiguous where it would be, would it be... it doesn't know if it's a broad biology brain movement. Yeah. Let's see. Beautiful biotech okay.

You know what? I know the point is, you can see in this demo that I built things moving and get a better intuition for how embedding models [work]. One thing I'll mention is this. What this example is not great because I only have a very small data set. If you have a lot bigger data set that you have applied PCA to and stored what you call eigenvectors, which is how I'm keeping this space stable as I change things, then you would have a better example, better ability to see things actually land where they are, but they don't, and I didn't have the time to make the example more fun.

In any case, semantic search. That's how... oh, sorry. One thing I wanna mention. Sorry. Okay. What's happening here is this. So if, for example, semantic [search] is why we, how we use this. You have something in mind, a movie that you wanna watch. Let's say the description of it is, it's Fight Club, right? You can just say, I want movies like Fight Club. How would recommendation system benefit from this? It will say simply find this movie's address in that point in latent space. Then walk around, get the nearest neighbors, 1, 2, 3, 4, maybe this one as well, and give those back to me. That could be the recommendations.

What's latent space? So latent space is the idea. I don't have an official meaning for, but the idea is that high dimensional space where these embeddings are being... these vectors... where those concepts are being put... you can call it latent space. You can also use latent space as a concept in large language models where you say within the weights, the matrix multiplication is happening and changing the vectors. The internal representation that the model has as latent space. I [like the definition] "the dream space of an AI, like all the things that are possible in reality, but that maybe haven't been done yet. The inner brain possibility space of an AI."

Honestly, that's a great way of thinking about it. And I find more intuition for that. When you're talking about stable diffusion visual models like vision models like Stable Diffusion. There it is a lot more obvious. 'cause you can literally, and this is the craziest, coolest thing ever, when Stable Diffusion was open sourced, you had videos of people talking about how you can do linear algebra and you have a picture of a ship flying in space, let's say.

And you do linear algebra towards certain direction and you'll see the ship transform into a plane or something or you'll see the ship, the sky turn into rain or something. So this is like just math, using math as a way to change the picture. And so there it was a lot more obvious that you were actually navigating it in space.

In this case it's... you can do it, there's like ways to visualize it. I have a different talk that I've done about how language models work and there I... not quite, I think I talk about this too much. So I'm gonna move on to the next part, which is after, okay, maybe I'll do more.

So I have, so after all this time, all this research, we have semantic search as well. We can ask a language model to find stuff and if it doesn't get right, we can give it feedback, et cetera. It still sucks for many reasons. Few that I want to get into: search engine optimization. The worst fucking thing I can think of in the last 15 years. Google's monopoly and a bunch of other companies, but certainly Google's monopoly has allowed them to simply dictate what they feel is representable, what they feel should be.

I personally am wondering like what happened, like when, at what point, 'cause I wasn't there for it. I certainly, who allowed a private index to be the de facto [index] for the open web? What a great idea? Who the fuck did that? Like I wasn't there meant it, I'm still not there. I admit I barely do anything, but what the fuck? Like the de facto index is a private [index], private thing and it'll have ads and it'll have its own profit motives. And that's okay with people? It knows even fighting it. You don't see every year a new thing trying to fight it. A private index.

Brilliant idea guys. So next thing is lack of... this one, I can't really blame on anyone. It is getting better now though, which is over the last 10 years, especially. 'cause it used to be much better. So the open web existed. A lot of the data now is videos, TikTok videos, YouTube videos, images that perhaps are hard to transcribe, et cetera, or caption, et cetera.

And as a result, all that piece of information is still buried somewhere in some person's channel. Can't access it. The information is there because we don't have access to it, because no one's got a proper enough index around it.

Next thing, this one really pisses me off is open communities have gone to shit because of policies that these private companies that somehow ran these supposedly open public spheres have chosen to do. For example Reddit, which pretty much everyone can generally in the last 15 years have assumed. It's like a public sphere. You go there, you share knowledge, you learn. Did anyone ever think when you were using Reddit oh this feels really nice to make another dollar for the CEO of Reddit? No. You were thinking like, I really love this topic. I'm engaging with the friends, the people around this who are also engaged in this. I'm learning from them. I'm gonna publish, contribute here as opposed to publishing a book about it.

These are the feelings that people had as they were talking on Reddit, and yet they closed their API. Now OpenAI and Google paid multi-$60, $70 million deals, and now they get to... only they can... they get to have the knowledge that most people using it considered to be public knowledge, that they're contributing openly. They don't feel like they're only contributing to a private tool. So there's that API lockdown, same thing happened with Twitter, don't even get started on Twitter. But like $40,000 per month for the APIs, pretty much like a no.

And similarly the kind of open source, open forums, which is, like Reddit and someone could be considered that. But also there used to be something like real open forum in 20 years ago. And now you have things like Discord and things like Slack, where even open source projects, Local Llama, a bunch of different, like Discord communities have Discords now and Stable Diffusion has a Discord.

Like it is so... all your conversations on Discord, non-scrapable, non-indexable. People are talking there and those things just vanish. So this means that people are still willing in this current moment to contribute openly to share the things that they care about, to share knowledge, to answer people's questions.

It just does not end up in a public space that I can find. What that means is gatekeeping, but what, not necessarily gatekeeping in this sense of different word for this. But it means that if you are someone who's looking for that information and you're not an insider, if you don't know where to look, if you're not part of that given Discord, if you're not part of that given community on Slack or on WhatsApp or whatever it may be, you simply cannot find that information.

So that information is opaque to you. Even though the people in that community, a hundred thousand person community has Stable Diffusion. Do you think those people are caring about privacy of the knowledge they're sharing though? They actually want to contribute publicly? It just happens to be that the medium is broken, right?

So many things and more contribute to this decline in the quality of search because nothing is now publicly indexed. The index itself is private, goes the motivation. It could... Do you want people to ask you questions or do you want to keep talking?

Okay, so I'll end in a half, half a minute, half second. I just wanna, I do wanna questions or do you want to keep presenting? Okay. Half a minute, you choose. Present. Okay, fine. I will say my last piece 'cause I was very [passionate] as I talked about, as I looked into this more and more, the theme that emerged was that things were not this bad. They didn't have to be this bad. They became this bad because of the choices that people made.

And information is the key thing here. Information that people want to share, not people want to share. That could be anything, ending up in a public index that doesn't anymore because of many reasons. StackOverflow no one goes to anymore 'cause they go to a private model. [Data] has always remained private, et cetera.

And one person that I found inspiration from as I was looking into who was, who had a clarity of vision about these things like no other was Aaron Swartz, whose words have been behind the slide and you can look into it. This is his manifesto, the Open Access Manifesto. And he talks about in complete clarity what we should be doing if you care about this mission of open access to knowledge.

And if you know the story of Aaron Swartz, he was hounded for downloading a bunch of information off of JSTOR, which is an MIT archive which was, from what I understood from recently researching a bit more, an open network. He just went over the limits, but they made it sound like he... he ended up doing a crime and then they pursued him for two years trying to charge him for 35 years, and then he killed himself. 

So that's just one person. But his clarity of purpose and his contributions to making RSS to a bunch of other things are significant. So anyway, I felt like as I was doing this talk, I got really nervous. I was like, you know what? I feel like it's much bigger than me. It's much bigger. This thing, it's even much bigger than semantic search. There's real things broken in the heart of search, and it'll take our efforts to fix it. Thank you.

### Q&A Session

**Kris:** Please hang on for [questions]. Come on, turn on. The lights are fucked. Will you turn off the audience lights and on the stage lights please? I think you know so much, man. You're like, yo, turn off the stage lights. I want to be really dark so people can really see my stuff. And I don't wanna stand here because I don't wanna stand in front of that one dot that I want them to really see.

You gotta trust me a little bit, bro. You gave three minutes of question and answer to say that piece about Aaron Swartz, and I'm a fucking Aaron Swartz supporter, so I appreciate it. But, we gotta land this shit together.

What was the main thing you wanted to show [people], man? Initially I wanted to talk about honestly, embeddings or semantics or something that I didn't get to. But as I went deeper into the topic, I realized much more important, at least, to this audience, than talking about how things work, which is cool. You'll be curious enough and find it and you can just bug me or, any kind of, 401 line.

The more important thing was to just remind people of the reality of where we are right now, which is everything is getting more and more closed. And unless we actively participate in the communities that we build, being more open, the software that we build, having different values, et cetera, we will continue to go down this road. It is not like you don't just get it for free. It's like the price of something.

**Kris:** Actually that's my first question is you do get it for free. And that's how they made the public web a private index is they gave us a lot of fucking utility for free. They gave us Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, all these things, right? And we slurped that shit up, and then we end up with private company owning the index of the whole public internet. So for all of us, like normals, how do you square that circle, man? That's how they ended up where they're at. We all still want Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, all that kind of shit. So how do we balance that equation? We can't all run those things on our own servers at home.

**Kush:** This is the other good question is like, what are the alternatives? And if you're willing to put the care and put the effort to actually create the alternative, right? It's not like I have... it's not like I created a social network that's open. So I made my own Photoshop, stuff. And that I can use and I'm very happy, if I can make it useful enough, then I can share with people and that's my approach. But certainly I'm not solving the problem.

So I do think that there is this philosophy that I've adopted a while ago now, which is that there's a Chomsky thing where if I can't fix it, I'm not gonna complain about it. Wrong. I'm wrong. I changed that completely. It doesn't matter if I can't fix it. If I see it's wrong, I gotta hate it.

And so I think the solution to that... I'm an anarchist and they tell me that I'm wrong 'cause I don't have the solution to come. What next? What comes next? And I'm like, I don't need to have the solution. My job is to say this is fucked, burn it down and then your guys' job is to find the solution.

So go ahead and keep critiquing the stuff. And I try in a little bit of trying to educate and be like, here's how you could try and build the system. But I certainly am not the kind of person who wants to get some VC money and make another thing that again, ends up being purchased private system.

And I certainly don't have the resources to get a big server farm together to produce and serve off service like this. And I just don't have faith in the current sort of incumbents of the current people in power [positions] of authority to do the right thing. If I do approach them from a nonprofit, from a [different perspective]. We got James, please.

**James (audience member):** So I have a question for you. So if we look back, who are you? I'm James Rowan from Circles of AI. Thank you. Alright. So my question is about lessons from history. So before digital, all knowledge was in books. Books were traditionally controlled by elites, but eventually the governments opened up libraries and that knowledge was made publicly available. Are there lessons to be drawn from this? I think that's the trend of information become more and more accessible over time.

**Kush:** And we saw some of the peak of that trend in the last let's say 10 years ago, whatever people really getting the ability to, and then actively sharing information on those forums. And then it became a regression from it. I definitely agree, like that's how the past has been. Information was the domain of the people who are the priests or whatever, and everyone else can go pound sand.

But over time we had more ability to share more, but we learn. I'm not saying it's a given default. Impact isn't the default is that people find... I think the default is not that people find that they want to keep things private. The default is that people in power find that they like power and so they keep it. I don't find general person to want to actually obtain more power. That's not gonna be a fantastic thing.

And one of the things that came up for me around the lockdown APIs, Reddit thing is it really sucks. If you're contributing to what you think is one type of community, then they lock it all down and you can't access it anymore. That's fucking cheating, right?

Think about it. Does anyone really ever truly think that they're on Reddit that, oh, like actually this is not public. Like this is these three people who are gonna read this. It's not public, but you are contributing to their proprietary data set goldmine that they're gonna exploit the fuck out.

Like you're actually enriching them. It's not just that you lost access to using your own stuff. That was exactly the last thing that I skipped, which is the closed source AI. That's why I keep going back because I don't find that open... the open source of closed source things in AI, same as in software, it's about information.

Actually, closed source AI is literally the information being locked down. 'cause an open source model is trillions of tokens or hundreds of gigabytes or whatever of information compressed and can [be] compressed from form so that you can even answer questions in an instruct model that is massively useful.

Imagine. So all the information that now ChatGPT gets because of all the people going to that model, Claude gets because people are using that model as opposed to Stack Overflow with the same people who are using Stack Overflow before. So it's not like this field of software engineering disappeared, it's that the entire information was now going into a black hole.

Stack Overflow is where people are still using it actively. There's not... I don't [see] any a strike and they went dark and so on, but many people are still using it. Like it's still a thing. And that information will never see the light of day in an open source model. That's right. And it'll just be in a [closed system] and then you'll be wondering how come closed source companies or Frontier. Yeah, they definitely have... It's because of smart scientist. You, yeah.

**Kris:** We have time for one more question for Kush. Does anyone else have one? I was gonna do Bartle Royale. I was gonna make you figure out who wanted to ask the question.

**Lauren (audience member):** So yesterday for some of the Web Summit attendees, we had a speech by the CEO of Bluesky who's creating an open source social media platform where other people, it seems very counter to what some of the other things are doing. I was wondering if you've looked into Bluesky at all and maybe what your take is on what they're doing. Are they actually doing, trying to combat this or is that just marketing?

**Kush:** Yeah, so this is actually one of the questions that's harder for me to answer because yes, I know a bunch of people around me who are using Bluesky, even as developers and they put some of the protocols around them and how to use the fire hose to build your own apps, et cetera.

But I myself have not really engaged with it as much because they, it is... I believe this, I'm not like a smart person. I'm almost certainly not smart enough to figure out nothing. What I find is I try to train my bullshit detector. Like being inspired from Carl [Sagan], thinking skills from Jordan Peterson sort of tradition.

Like I don't need to know everything to try and suss out the bad actors or people that are, cynical about these things. And I just don't have a general inclination to lean in full heart, fully into something that came out of a CEO that already had built a different kind of world.

Did not put it into action. They say that, yeah we built this protocol because we wanted to put it into production. Okay. What took you so long? What happened? Okay. And then you sold the company that was okay with you. So there's so many things that they say. Yeah, it's when Google bought Project Ara, it was called, it was a video.

I'll never forget this. There was a video. I inspired the shit outta me. I was studying in this at the time, phone blocks. It was this guy talking about a modular phone, and it was gonna be, this is a pretty big digression, but modular phone. They, you switch out the cameras, switch out the screen, come, awesome stuff.

And Google was like, oh, we're gonna hire the guy. We're gonna make this product. They hired the guy. Everyone was very inspired. They called the project Project Ara, they shut it down [later]. No one will ever attempt it again. For all I know. It's because of, some kind of rights or IP stuff that they made happen.

But I don't see anyone trying that stuff again. Is it because that idea is shit? It is because everyone learned that lesson. Their modular phones not a thing. No, it's because this is what happens, yeah. I don't just, I just don't buy that entity that made billions, trillions that's subscribed off of being private is gonna suddenly produce something that is open source.

Doesn't mean the people working there don't have those values. It's not gonna lean into that. It's a protocol. There's a hundred more. Yeah.

**Kris:** Thank you, Kush. We appreciate it. Woo. I encourage you to check out his YouTube journal. He's got a lot of great videos that he's made explaining this stuff that he then went and edited in an open source video editor tool that he created himself from scratch. He's the real deal. Thanks Kush. Seriously. Woo.

What [you hear] too? I'm sorry that you feel crunched for time, and I hope to build a whole event series devoted to your anger and righteousness and let you just run that whole thing, bro. I'm into it. Let's do it. Yep.

## Closing Keynote: Indi Genomics AI Platform
**Speaker:** [[Carol Ann Hilton]]

### **Kris:** Okay. So this is the final keynote here that we're about to enter into is about 15 minutes. We need a drink, grab one. You need a bathroom, grab one. But I encourage you to open your heart, open your mind, take a deep breath, and things are gonna change a little bit here.

[[Carol Ann Hilton]] is up next from the Indi Genomics Institute, and the Global Center of Indi Genomics. It's a place that I am happy to get to spend my time working sometimes and collaborate with her. But truly she inspired me in lots of ways and I'm very happy that she gets to come tonight.

Carolann's taught me a lot about ceremony and ritual and doing that first as a way of bringing people together. And so when Gabriel tonight was talking and sharing his song and stuff, I felt like that's a lot of the things that you brought into my world is the ability to understand what that means better and as a white settler ally and start to better understand how I can bring that into this and really make it a center of what we do around here.

And Carolann and I have been on AI journey the last year and a half together. She has developed some amazing tools. She has brought her whole team along with her on the journey and they are an indigenous technology, AI first organization. And I'm excited to invite you up tonight to share what is ever on your mind with us, Carolann.

### [[Carol Ann Hilton]] - Indi Genomics Institute

Is this on? Hello there. We're good evening everyone. [[Carol Ann Hilton]], hey. I am Nuu-cha-nulth from the west coast of Hesquiaht Nation. Happy to be here. I tend my regards to the twin sisters, the mountain peaks that tell us of this land or the place of how we behave as humans. The teachings that are deeply embedded in the landscape of this place and the place that brings the message across the ancient languages, which is the original language model, is indigenous languages.

To be able to look at this place and to realize the vibration of the quality of consciousness, of the care, of how we show up as human beings, that is Indi Genomics. It's about economy as ceremony. It's about economy as how we move through the world. It's about how we as human beings learn to interact of our presence, of our leadership, and of impact across time.

In leading the development of Indi Genomics movement, I met Kris. And one of the first questions that I asked was, how can AI help to ground the Indi Genomics movement, which is moving nationally and globally to be able to use and frame Indi Genomics within? What is the opportunity that AI provides us?

I think it becomes extremely important to understand in a tool set, beginning to build and beginning to understand what is the constructive and the deep constructive space. So in looking at this realization of this concept of how do we build an indigenous focused AI system, my work is entirely an indigenous economic design.

It's about bringing focus into the evolution of the indigenous economic relationship. So I wrote this book called The Rise of Indigenous Economic Power. So I did this thing and I assessed essentially that the ability of this country to stand in the truth of the Indian Act is a formidable moment that we're in.

Because our ability to understand and bring focus to the deconstructive element of economy from the indigenous perspective, and to understand the formative relationship that we're in terms of the rise of indigenous economic power, we look to the entrance where we drove in, where an indigenous development changes the entire skyline to realize that ability and the understanding of what that means and why that's important.

In this book, I read the original Indian Act into an AI system and did a series of analysis that in the first one, if the Indian Act was a human, this is what it would sound like. To be able to reduce that to the human thought that forms and shapes and coded the indigenous reality in this country. To break that down into, if this was one person speaking, you're not allowed to move. You're not allowed to speak, you're not. All of these aspects of this, as a person ran that through the Global Mental Disorder manual to realize that this is actually a very sick individual.

So AI can bring our attention to an ethical space in an innovative way. This concept of how we embedded AI into the process of how do you grow a global movement. And I think that the first was a series of tools that supported our team to be able to utilize it within the construction of a book of deconstructing Canadian reality, of our understanding of the Indian Act, to look at it within our event systems, to be able to reflect and look at a language evolution of a language model of indigenous, how indigenous people describe business, how we do business, and essentially the fundamental aspects of the principles of that.

I think the other dynamic of this is we realize that we just put our whole team through an AI skill set, how we use that within the creative force of the company itself. I think to realize that the embedding of this as a process. That our response to be able to do this from an indigenous perspective, one of the main pieces of work that we did was establish the Indi Genomics AI engine to look at it as an indigenous economic intelligence platform to be able to describe value from an economic perspective outside of the constructs of GDP and largely how are indigenous peoples creating economic value and how is that value unaccounted for?

I've set out to look at a hundred billion dollar indigenous economy, and through the use of AI, we are looking at well over a $200 billion indigenous economy to be able to bring into focus the understanding of unexamined space. I think that's what we're doing within Indi Genomics and the concept and experience of it.

I could speak further on this experience and understanding of intelligence and to frame this concept of building an AI system through an indigenous worldview, through a strength-based narrative. And to look at it through the concept of intelligence as an expansive space that has been stolen from us through our humanity, through the systems, and through the limitations of what has been imposed on us as a whole.

People, not just indigenous people. AI brings that alignment to what is the possibility of intelligence? What is the intelligence of our response, and how does that ground us in our humanity as an eternal person?

Mindset matters in everything that we do. My leadership within this movement is grounding our traditional values, respect, kindness, abundance, intergenerational wealth. How do we build a system that reflects our humanity, but brings that to our core values of who we are and how we relate to each other, to the land, to our future. Thank you.

### Q&A with Carolann

**Kris:** So for those unfamiliar, the Indian Act is what defines what it means to be an indigenous person in Canada, more or less legally. Like what rights you have, how to operate and the rest. So you're telling me you put the Indian Act into ChatGPT, and then you took, and you said personify this. Tell me about the person this Indian Act would be, and then you took that persona and you stuck it into the mental disorder database and they told you it was fucked.

**Carolann:** Yep.

**Kris:** Tell me more. I have three of these books for sale and I gotta run.

**Carolann:** All right, one last question. Does anyone have a burning question they need to ask Carolann? I'm gonna hit a little more. Where are you going anyway? You go to the Frontier Collective thing. Somewhere. Good.

Come on. Why don't you [call next] [[Carol Ann Hilton]]. Thank you very much. Woo.

## Closing Remarks

### **Kris:** Okay. The next 14 speakers are gonna be a lot shorter than Carolann, so thanks for sticking around. You did it. Thank you so much for coming and participating in the BC AI ecosystem. What we got going on here, if you got something you wanna share in the future, hit me up. There's room for everybody around here.

I appreciate your contributions. Kevin, you throw up the QR codes, that's where you can get more. That's the Surrey event if you live out there. This is our next event here. There's my cute robo Canadian Goose logo. This is the cheap tickets for a year program. Core membership hit up. It's a great value and it's better than trying to get those early birds every month.

There's only a few left of them. Thank you very much, everyone. I'll be... Proj Wall is the valedictorian of his high school and has invited me to go to his graduation at the Chance Center. So I'll see you next week Proj. Congratulations.

Ron. Thanks for bringing your family. If you haven't had a chance to meet [family members], Tyler over there. You should definitely say hello before we leave. Woo. Thank you. [Hope you'll be here.]
