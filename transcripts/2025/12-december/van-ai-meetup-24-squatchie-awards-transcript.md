## Opening & Indigenous Welcome

### Kris Krüg (Host)

AI meetup December 2025!!!

How's going, everybody?

How? Welcome. You're at the Vancouver AI community. You up with H.R. MacMillan Space Centre. This is number 24 for two years in a row. Every month we've been coming together to be like, what the fuck is up with AI? I don't know. I'm trying to— I'm trying to figure it out myself, you know.

Thank you very much for being here. We got an exciting show for you tonight. We're gonna get things kicked off here properly. We got friends of the family, **Gabriel George Sr.** with us here tonight from the **Tsleil-Waututh Nation**. Woo.

How awesome has it been to have **Anthony Joseph** with us the last couple months? Man, that guy should try a stand-up comedy room soon. That hilarious. And yeah— what a great gift he's given us.

Gabriel, I just wanna welcome you up here again. When I was talking to him the other day— trying to talk him into it because really, really busy time of year— I was like, "Yo, a couple of those cranes came down from… the building across the street, you know, where the Squamish are building the towers. It's a beautiful view right now in the sunshine. You should come check it out."

So thank you so much for being here, friend.

---

### Gabriel George Sr. (Tsleil-Waututh Nation)

Good to be here.

To all of you, my dear friends, family, welcome you here to this beautiful village of **[unclear place name]**.

One of my great-grandmothers lived in this village, and I'm part of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. And I also have lineage into Squamish and Musqueam, and we share a similar language to the people **[unclear]**.

The root is **[unclear]** for "inside" and **[unclear]** is the suffix for the back of the head. So it's like the head inside.

And at one time, False Creek at low tide went all the way up towards Clark Street, and you could access Burrard Inlet on the inside of False Creek. During high tide, Stanley Park became an island during high tide.

And these are some of the **[unclear]** and some of our old people's thoughts that were passed down to me— some of our history, our knowledge of the land.

My late uncle, he talked about the— and he said the elk would be up at Burnaby Mountain. In our language **[unclear]** is the elk and **[unclear]** was our name for Burnaby Mountain, and **[unclear]**. And he said when they would arrive here, the elk, that's when our people would harvest them.

As Tsleil-Waututh people, we have always had— the name of our people loosely translates as the people of Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm, the people of the inlet. And we've always— the inlet has sustained us for thousands of years.

The archaeological evidence shows how it sustained us through waterfowl, through the fish, through shellfish, through the salmon, different fishes— and it sustained us for thousands of years.

And we continue to have a deep understanding of our land, including the impacts— the shoreline loss, the things that have harmed our way of life, our way of being, and harmed what we consider to be our grandmother— Burrard Inlet.

That's our understanding of this world, **[unclear word]** we call— and that we don't see ourselves as separate from the water, separate from the mountains, separate from the things that have roots, separate from the things with fur— our relatives with fur and feathers— that we are all interconnected.

And science understands that as well. The health of our food systems, the health of the environment— it affects our health as human beings.

And so that's just some of my family's understanding and some of our history on this land.

In my Tsleil-Waututh history there, our first ancestor, he was transformed from a wolf into a young boy, **[unclear]**— and the animals were his first teacher.

And one of those first teachers was the **[unclear]**, and that's the grizzly bear. And the grizzly bear taught him many things: how to harvest food; about spirituality— because the bears will hibernate.

It is one of the many relatives that have been chased off these lands due to deforestation.

And so I want to sing this grizzly bear song. The words in the song actually are **[unclear]**. It translates as: "We are all one, our Indigenous people." And tonight, I extend that to all of us. We are all one as a people.

Our ancestors would say that we're all in this together— despite our backgrounds, our beliefs— despite all these things, we are still in this canoe that they call Canadian society.

And the bear— the grizzly bear in particular— brought a peace between our tribes on the coast and some of our relatives in the interior. And so I also see this grizzly bear song as a kind of peace song.

**[Sings]**

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thanks for being here with us again tonight, man. I really appreciate it. Give it up for our buddy, Gabriel George, man.

Organizing these things every month— Gabriel is not that easy— but I swear I would do it just to come hear you sing and share with us, man. It's like— if that was the only reason, I would still do it though.

Thank you.

Well, you found yourself at an award ceremony tonight. You know, this community— we said we were gonna start 24 months ago— we're gonna do something and we're gonna make something out of it. We're gonna create something that people hadn't seen around here. And we did it.

And out of that, our whole ecosystem has grown. Matthew came to me, said, "I want to take this, I wanna bring it out to Surrey." And it began the spreading of the thing.

Then Andrew came to me and said, "Yo, let's turn this into a nonprofit and really take it to the next level." And I'm like— every single time we say something, we kinda like reach out and grab it and pull it unto ourselves together, you know?

And so this award ceremony is just like us planting the flag in the ground saying that we wanna honor and recognize our own. We wanna lift people up, and we want to give some love back to the people that have contributed so much to the community.

So that's what you're gonna get tonight. Don't worry— it won't be long. I got six awards I'd like to give out tonight. It'll be fun to celebrate them with you.

But before we get there— we all participated in a little musical collaboration earlier. How fun was that?

Well, as usual, Patrick Parra-Pennefather has been up to all sorts of shenanigans. So I wanna welcome Patrick and his choir up here to talk a little bit about what's been going on.

---

## Musical Interlude

### Patrick Parra-Pennefather

Thank you, Kris, and welcome back.

So for all of you who did not know the surprises— as you were walking in, that music was your music. That was all your voices, and we did several remixes through **Suno**, and it is available for you to use and happy to share that.

Fire Angels was— these— that was them.

Kevin— can we have a little excerpt, just really quick, and then— yeah.

Wait, you want me to do— you can— well, let's just let—

I gotta put him on the spotlight like that.

Hi, Kevin. How are you?

1, 4, 2. Here we go. Single out. That's probably me there.

Your voices are incredible, by the way. I have never heard such amazing voices in my life, so let's applaud you. Nice job.

So— Kris didn't hear this and I thought it'd be nice for him to hear this as well as we'll add another little challenge and they're gonna record it all and then maybe we'll do another remix for real for next meetup— promise— it'll be the next one.

Why don't we start— everyone just give me the snaps. One, two.

Now here's the tricky part: you gotta remember where you were in the room, and it might be a little fuzzy, given the alcohol that you've consumed. Maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong, Gabriel. Subtle.

Where are my do-do-do-do-do-do guys? Right. Okay. I see you— and lead it. Do, do, do do. Nice voice. Yeah. Do, do.

Little louder. Do— louder. Do, do— do. Keep it going, keep it going.

And now we need the ho-ho-ho. Ho, ho, ho.

We need more ho, ho, sound. Ho, ho, ho. I see some of my ho—

Come on. Louder. Ho, ho, ho.

Okay. My "oh yes." Oh yes.

Wait for it— and "oh yeah." Nice. For those of you who missed it— perfect. Yeah, keep that going. For those of you who missed it: "oh yeah."

You get to do another little call and response thing to see if you can do this challenge, because I'm highly influenced by Cab Calloway— anyone who knows him.

So we're gonna do a little bit of variation on that.

"Oh yeah." Just to finish off this little sequence. Here we go. Are you ready? Oh yeah.

Repeat after me: "A tipsy tipsy tip do tips."

A tipsy, tipsy, tipsy do— tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy tipy do— tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy tips— tip, tip, tip bad— a tipy tip do tip— tip, tip do tip— do tip, do tip— tip, tip do.

Alright. Let's bring this to a close with some ho, ho, ho. Everybody with a ho, ho, ho— and ho, ho, ho. One more time. Here we go— and finish it. Ho, ho, ho.

Yeah.

Thank you, everybody.

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Alex— thank you. Isaac— thank you, sir. Thank you guys. Thank you Zara.

Alex was rocking the bar out there for like two years for us— secretly a really fancy musician who's been looking for a chance to get up here. So I'm happy you bringing your cousin in to help with bar so you can spend more time up here making music with us.

Alright.

Those visuals behind us there were by Mr. Pixel Wizard over here. He's been tinkering with all sorts of generative backgrounds and experiences where you can just pop up some lights and pop up a projector and all of a sudden the things that are changing in the background are responsive to whatever's coming outta the speaker's mouth. That's a little bit of what you were seeing there behind.

What do you want up now? Right now, Kris?

---

### [Unclear speaker]

I mean, we could just— how about my trip to Mexico, me eating a thousand tacos in Mexico next week, please. That's what's on my mind.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thank you. That's my goal. A thousand. Someone told me that that's actually 27 per day. That was based on the amount of days I'm gonna be there, so— but I'm gonna try. I'm gonna give it my best shot.

Alright. Okay.

Now we got our little community announcements section and I welcome a couple of you who have announcements to make to come rock on up here with a quickness.

Who's got some announcements they wanna make that are part of this community?

Oh my God. Usually people have to fucking like get told. You're a quiet bunch.

New year.

Okay— Kevin?

---

## Community Announcements

### Kevin (AI Film Club)

This is our Christmas present to you folks.

The first actual for real, for real, for real— and that's not just my last name— monthly meetup of the AI Film Club is happening, and it's gonna happen the second Thursday of every month.

The first one is gonna be this coming Thursday, January 8th, at the new Multimodal Media Lab, which is an old WeWork space that has been converted into the very early generation of this wild community creative space that is incorporating AI, VR, AR, large LED screens.

They've got some fantastic infrastructure to help facilitate what we're bringing to the table here in bringing this experience of filmmaking at a world caliber— visual effects, animation at a world caliber— and getting us all together and just jamming and talking about it all the time and really converting our knowledge base and our acuities into something that the world can be envious of once again.

So I'm really excited with Kris and Luke and Mayumi to bring this together, and **[unclear name]** who's the creative director at Multimodal— it's an amazing space and I can't wait to kick this all off with you.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Don't go anywhere. I'm not stealing it permanently, but we only got one mic in the moment.

It's true. I like to share.

I'm grinning like a fool over here because **[unclear name]** started this Multimodal Media Lab here. He's a member of our community and of our nonprofit.

He was in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday at **[unclear]** Studio, which is like the biggest volumetric camera, virtual production stage that I've ever seen— like owned by Paramount and other— he's in the sweetest places.

He's a curator for SIGGRAPH. He's brought a lot of good things our way. He's partnered up with this. He's hosted a year of them at his space. The first three invites are on Luma. They're free.

Yeah, they're free. Come hang out. Come bring your laptop. Show us what you've been working on. Come hang out on the AI film channel. It's fucking thriving.

Sal made his first film the other day. All sorts of people. Jason made his first film a couple weeks ago or whatever. So like the whole thing's really thriving.

You've done a great job, man. And I'm just grinning over here 'cause it's so— we got a sweet venue now.

There's— we do the Vancouver AI meetup— don't even have three invites on Luma for the next year. But yeah.

---

### Kevin (AI Film Club)

And it's for all skill levels as well. If you're just curious, you've loved film forever and you want to dig in with a bunch of folks who have done it for a while and shoot the shit and get the best of the pointers of whatever bat shit model has come out that week— we're gonna be there to get on the ins and outs of it and jam together with it. It's truly collaborative. Super excited about it.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

You gotta be careful what you asked for around here.

This nice lady was waving me down on the corner of the stage being like, "Kris. Kris."

Do you guys know who this is? This is **Rox McNaulty**.

Rox has been running the front desk helping with registration since this thing began. Rox has brought so many awesome people into this mix. You're a good friend to many, including myself. I'm always happy when I see you show up.

What would you like to say, Rox?

---

### Rox McNaulty (Fashion Futures / AI Apparel)

Okay. We are part of MML as well and we are doing a Fashion Futures— AI apparel comp.

So it's supposed to be up and rolling next month with a workshop. And then we've got 12 sessions at four hours a piece where we're doing AI fashion, 3D apparel softwares.

We've got some amazing editorial softwares from one of the locals here and some very interesting softwares from Hong Kong.

So the idea is to gather up AI fashion softwares but give you a real base of what's happening in the industry. I just finished speaking in Hong Kong at PI Apparel, all about AI fashion.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Wow. Thanks, Rox. I'm so excited for you.

Rox has been messing with the most interesting emerging creative technologies as it relates to fashion design and merchandising and kind of getting your stuff out there into the world for 20 years. So I'd love to come to your course.

---

### Patrick Parra-Pennefather (Equitable Voice Portal)

Alright— so if anyone is interested: funding has been approved through various sources for an Equitable Voice Portal in which we will be experimenting.

Tom at the back, right? Actor Tom— thank you.

We're basically tearing apart different text-to-speech open-source machine learning models, and we are working with actors to record six to eight hours.

Every actor has 100% sovereignty over their own voice and say over how their voice is used. This is the difference.

And so we're doing that. We're trying to build up a business model probably over the next six months for that as well.

So anyone wanna be involved, let me know.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Happy. Thanks.

I'm gonna do cake. It's my birthday week. I get to do whatever I want.

I got a couple people who I want them to tell you about their communities.

Andrea, I'm coming for you next. Marc— 30 seconds on your community.

---

### Marc Busse (CreativeMornings / Likemind Vancouver)

Oh, geez.

Um— fifth— this is our 15th year. Every month: free breakfast, free music, and access to someone— in a few months, like that guy— who will share their relationship, their journey, their struggles with creativity.

It's called CreativeMornings. Happens at the art gallery. And on January 9th, we are the first chapter— we were the first chapter in Canada— we're now in 255 cities in 70 countries around the world, 2 million subscribers.

All that being said: on January 9th, we are the first chapter on the planet who's hosting an award-winning artist, filmmaker, actor, director with Down syndrome.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Oh wow. Thanks, Marc.

Andrea Mills— Internet Archive Canada.

---

### Andrea Mills (Internet Archive Canada)

Thank you, Kris. Hi everyone.

I am the Executive Director of Internet Archive Canada. Next year we're celebrating 20 years in Canada, stealthily operating in Canada.

The last four years or so, we have a building downtown on West Pender Street where we're doing events, hackathons, conferences. It's a space for the open world, which I think maybe there's some constituents here in the room.

Lovely to have the first time meeting some people in the room. I hope this isn't the last time.

We have data. I think all of you might need data for some of the work that you're doing, so this is not the last time that you'll see me.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thank you, Andrea.

Saan coming your way. And then Gord, you're number four. And then we're moving on.

Just talk a little about your club.

---

### Saan [last name unclear] (Sauder AI Club - UBC)

Alright. I'm Saan **[unclear]**. Nice to see everyone.

I've got my co-president, Steve, here for the first time. Ari and Phoebe as well from our MBA program at UBC.

Actually, this fine young gentleman is gonna be coming to do a little panel discussion.

We're gonna be doing a political, economic and institutional academic discussion on AI and what it means for MBA students moving forward.

So I really appreciate you, my man.

Keep your eye on this guy and the **Sauder AI Club**. They're doing very interesting things. Data for good.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Cheers.

Gordon Hamilton.

---

### Gordon Hamilton (Data for Good)

We run a little group that is able to help nonprofits by bringing data skills.

We have data engineers, data analysts, data wannabees, and they come together in the group and resolve issues for nonprofits who really don't know how valuable their data is.

And so— and we do it for nothing. So it helps with their budget and it's really, really satisfying.

If you ever wanna just check us out: VancouverDataforGood.ca.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Cheers.

Gord has built an amazing community.

I know I said that was it, but— VAM reading group.

---

### Kush Goenka (VAM Reading Group)

Oh shit. Oh— um, okay, so this is unexpected.

A friend of mine, **[unclear]**, has been just nailing it in terms of community building.

He organizes very **[unclear]** events, but he recently had the idea of organizing a reading group— not just every other week as I'm used to for the last couple of years— but every week.

So now every week on a Thursday, I go to his reading group— or our reading group— and I wake up, read a paper, and show up and we discuss. It's more focused on the latest releases in terms of AI— multimodal, various different things.

And there's also other ones that are more ML-heavy that happens every other week.

So yeah— VAM— Vancouver AI Meetup— I mean whatever it is— look up on Luma and there's always someone nerding out somewhere, you know? Including tomorrow evening, and then Saturday morning, and then next Thursday— so yeah, forever.

So come hang out, you know. Make it a podcast.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thank you, Kush.

If you didn't come up here when I said it was open mic, you should have. I'm not gonna keep this thing going.

But we are gonna keep it going next year. Those are our dates. That's the last Wednesday of every month in 2026. Contract signed. Sponsors locked down. We're making it happen— except for the last one of the year.

Well— no— if you like it, come hang out. The room will be twice as full 'cause everyone won't be on vacation.

Out of this, I said, we formed a nonprofit society. A lot of you folks are members. Thanks for putting your little ticket to ride in the middle and trying to make something more than what we have right now in BC.

It's been beautiful watching everyone come together and the network grow.

So that's Lorraine Lowe. She runs the Space Centre. She's one of the founding board members.

That's me when I had full beard.

And that's Carol Anne Hilton, who I work with at the Indigenomics Institute, and she's also a board member of BC + AI.

So there'll be a chance to join later if you feel like it, but that's who we are and what we're up to.

Alright, Peter. I mean, bro. I make you come up here and be the boring guy.

This is my business partner and closest collaborator, **Peter Bittner**.

He came up from Seattle today for this here tonight. A lot of you guys have met him in August when he first came up.

Peter and I sat next to each other in school at a Google accelerator for media companies at the end of 2023, and we were the only two guys building AI-focused media companies.

We got to know each other, and then we started our businesses, and we started helping each other with our businesses— coaching each other's classes and stuff like that.

And then we realized that like— no man is an island to himself— that we should do this together. And so we merged our companies.

We've been running our company together for the last year and a half. Many people here have been through the program.

Actually, it was really cool to see— we got like five different AI education programs.

We decided to sponsor these awards here tonight.

So the awards that are given out, everyone gets a free course— one of our free courses— they can keep it for themselves or they can give it to one of their students or their colleagues or their coworkers or something.

But that's in addition to these fancy hand-blown glass trophies— Peter's gonna be giving out some scholarships tonight.

Anyway, our sponsor's gonna give two minutes about what we do.

---

## Sponsor Presentation

### Peter Bittner (TheUpgrade.ai)

Thank you, Kris. Well, I'm thrilled to be back. Yeah, it's great to see so many familiar faces. I see some students.

Just round applause for staying close to these teachers up here.

We have courses. We have had the pleasure of working with some amazing students from all sorts of professions across numerous industries— literally thousands of them, which is really hard to believe— close to two years ago now.

We've had the honor working with folks from Apple, NASA, Salesforce, and even just the slash cohorts— so many amazing companies that are well established, but also some of the most fun ones are the ones that haven't started yet, right? Or in the middle of cool sort of catharsis or exploration.

We have six-week courses that are cohort-based. They're online. People show up from all over the world actually— UK, sometimes Asia time even, which is kind of mind-blowing.

Everyone's there with a mission of exploration and a mindset of curiosity.

We help to guide people through structured learning as well as experimentation, hands-on exercises. Every six-week cohort culminates with a capstone project that's up to each student to create.

We're thrilled to be supporting sponsor of these awards tonight and the event to help make that opportunity available to more of you in BC + AI and Vancouver AI Meetup community.

I do want to talk about Matthew Schwartzman. I asked him, "Hey, how would you recommend that I summarize your experience in our course?" and you said "opening up a new world," so that was less than two seconds.

That's our goal, right?

We have them for numerous professions. We've tailored them. We've run each of these at least twice— in some cases 10 times or close to it— for the creative pros.

If you're curious about enhancing and upskilling in AI, we would love to have you come to one of our courses.

And we're thrilled that we'll be able to give out a scholarship to each of the recipients tonight that can be regifted if they'd like.

So thanks for having me.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thanks for coming up, Peter.

Yo— especially in these last couple cohorts, the capstone projects have blown me outta the fucking water. It's amazing— going from "I don't know what's going on with AI" to six weeks later launching an idea, product, business, whatever.

Alright. On with the show.

I've never done this before and there's a couple things that I wanna say that are important.

So I made some notes— let you guys know— I won't stick to the script and I will not drone on and on, but bear with me. I am going to read at a couple points tonight.

So— welcome to the **Squatchies**. Why the fuck is it called the Squatchies?

Our ecosystem has a BC accent. We're not trying to be Silicon Valley and we're not trying to be Toronto. This is forest meets ocean meets code meets culture.

Squatch is a creature with big footprints, a lot of lore, and a habit of showing up precisely when the conditions are right.

The Squatchies are our way of saying that we recognize our own— the builders, the organizers, educators, artists and bridge people.

The folks that create the conditions for our success in thriving and allow us to go after things bigger than any one of us can go after ourselves.

When we started talking about these awards, all the normal corporate names came up, like the BC + AI Excellence Awards— all sorts of different types of things like that.

But we realized that just wasn't us.

The Squatchies landed 'cause it tells us the truth about this place.

BC makes things that don't fit into neat categories. We mix art and science. We mix public good and entrepreneurship. We mix deep research and do-it-yourself experimentation.

Squatchies mean local recognition from your friends and collaborators who watched you build shit right in front of their eyes.

Okay. Here we go.

---

## The Awards

### Squatchie Award #1: Anthonia (Ethos Lab)

**Category:** Community Infrastructure & Youth Education

### Kris Krüg (Host)

The first Squatchie goes out to someone building the kind of infrastructure that I know our city needs.

Anthonia runs Ethos Lab on Main— a Black and Indigenous youth center that does real creative work, real tech work with real youth in real time.

This fall, I watched Anthonia's team at Ethos ship an AI Studio project that was both playful and technical. Sixteen-year-old youths made a sleep-tracking mobile game where dreams turn creatures into something you can capture, trade, and train.

She's turning assignments into learning in a way that isn't homework.

In January, she's launching another AI lab for BIPOC youth on Friday nights— January through June. We're talking assistant agents, knowledge bases, vibe coding, game developers.

Many of you have spoken at these labs. The point is reps— access to tools and technology— and empowerment. Gaining real confidence.

She also co-leads our BC + AI education subgroup where she's lined up the resources, the room. She holds the space. She gets the gear. She makes it possible.

Anthonia, thank you for being such a community engine. Come on up here and grab your Squatchie.

---

### Anthonia (Ethos Lab)

Oh man. Thank you so much, Kris. Thank you. BC + AI— thank you for all of your incredible support.

I've learned a lot from seeing how you've moved here with care and with deep concern and thoughtfulness for community, and I'm really excited for what we're gonna be able to cook up next year.

Very quick plug: Kris has shared he's gonna be working with us and hopefully a few of you in the room are gonna be involved in some of those workshops coming in January all the way to June, getting these young kids ready for our annual Black History Hackathon.

It's gonna be an AI-enabled hackathon this year honoring Hogan's Alley, and they're gonna be hacking Hogan's Alley.

So thank you, all of you in the room, for getting these young people ready.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

I had the funnest time at Ethos on Saturday. There was an open house there. The youth that had been going through the AI Studio got to present their app to their parents and to funders and to other people that were there.

Anthonia's been given custodianship of a whole block in front of her building— closed to cars, given to the youth— and they're architecting the space of their dreams right there at Main and 3rd.

Plug into what they're doing. Support it if you can. If you're not in a position to support, tell me if you want to volunteer there, help out.

Alright. We did one. That was the first one ever.

---

### Squatchie Award #2: Gokhan Basaran

**Category:** Government Innovation & Community Bridge-Building

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Up next: the next Squatchie is for a very specific kind of builder— someone who turns bureaucracy into traction.

**Gokhan Basaran** works in government innovation around here. He shows up as a translator and a connector.

He spent serious time helping founders and early projects understand how to access programs, how to sharpen their pitch, and how to move through the system without losing months to confusion— trying to navigate bureaucratic, federal political mazes.

He does matchmaking, intros. He helps people aim high and at the right target.

He also brought strong relationships into our orbit, including big companies and serious institutional players. There might still be some Amazon credits for all of us in our future.

People who usually stay behind polished walls and don't always feel comfortable in these spaces— you've been a bridge for that.

That type of work rarely gets clapped for because it's mostly private conversations, invitations, quiet wins, but it changes outcomes.

Thanks for turning policy into pathway and pathway into momentum for this community. You're a bridge. Come get your Squatchie, sir.

---

### Gokhan Basaran

So you say I got the "Y" part right, but the "K" part wrong— more like "Yo, Ken."

I think every day he's getting closer to saying my name properly. I think he said it right, but he just missed the H in my name. But that's fine. Progress makes it perfect.

Thanks for this award. I really appreciate that.

It's been exactly one year since I met Kris. When he mentioned his vision and the community— the people, the energy— I was like, "Hey, am I gonna be the only business guy trying to fit in here?"

But I came to the first event in April and the depths of the conversations we have here— the community, the openness, the sincerity— everyone was welcoming.

It's so inclusive and I'm glad to be part of it. This award is great in terms of our work being recognized. So I feel less lonely and more impactful.

I just wanna thank the two nice ladies here that just came specific for me— and one of them could be the earliest adopter here, the youngest attendee— my daughter.

In my part-time, I try to develop AI tools and try to make my boring job more automated and try to become a full-time successful dad.

And if anyone is into wind sports: I love wind sports— trying to wing foil in Jericho and Squamish.

Thank you.

### Kris Krüg (Host)

My pleasure, man. Thanks for being part of this. I'm serious.

Gokhan and I have weekly phone calls and they mean a lot to me. He busts my gears sometimes about shit that goes on here, but it's part of getting things on the right track.

We got one of those truth-speaking trust relationships, and I'm grateful for it.

### Squatchie Award #3: Arshia Sobhan (MetaCreation Lab - SFU)

**Category:** Cultural AI & Open-Source Innovation

### Kris Krüg (Host)

This next Squatchie is about craft.

**Arshia Sobhan** is a PhD researcher at SFU's MetaCreation Lab working with Philippe Pasquier. His focus is generative AI for calligraphy and Arabic script— not as an aesthetic trend— as a serious practice rooted in cultural continuity, structure, and respect.

Essentially: when you get generative AI to make Arabic calligraphy, it makes it look "oriental," but it doesn't say shit. And that's a problem.

Arshia's been working for years inside the MetaCreation Lab to better understand generative calligraphy, generative hand scripts.

He does beautiful work, and he's also been a major contributor to the open-source **AutoLoom** project that a lot of us use— as a neural visual synthesizer as we're training models on our own work and stuff.

He's led workshops all over the world— Europe, Montreal, the East Coast— teaching people how to use open-source tools to train ethical models on their own work.

There's so many artists people wanna say resist AI. Some do. Some are exploring ways to train models on their own work they own— in ways that are ethical and justice-focused.

Arshia carries a rare combo: deep technical capability, real artistic practice, cultural literacy. He treats tradition like living knowledge, not just style.

He shows up for this community— teaching artists how these systems actually work, sharing workflows, running trainings, helping creators move from prompting black boxes to building tools with agency.

Arshia, come get your Squatchie.

### Arshia Sobhan

Thank you so much. It was a surprise. I didn't expect this tonight.

I wish Philippe was here— Philippe Pasquier is my research supervisor at the MetaCreation Lab. I'm glad for him 'cause he is taking some time off after the busy year. So it's good that he's not here.

About AutoLoom— let me give you some context very briefly.

What I'm trying to do is— I don't know if you have had this feeling of working with AI and feeling like it doesn't feel natural, and that feeling for artistic creation is more intense when your artistic domain is non-Western.

Because these systems are not neutral. They're designed in a certain place for certain people with certain goals, and it's not inclusive necessarily.

So I do art-making with generative AI with my own Persian calligraphy practice. And it feels like walking in a very thick fog.

You need to make sense of where you are— if you want to be there— if it feels good, if it feels bad.

So it's a lot of experimentation and ambiguity.

With AutoLoom we have tried to create a system that provides more control for artists with different practices.

They don't need to necessarily work within the biases of pre-trained models— large-scale AI systems designed by corporate AI.

You can train your own model from scratch using your data only, and you will have full control over the creative practice.

So if you're curious about AutoLoom, come talk to me. I will provide you with all the links and more information.

Thank you so much.

### Kris Krüg (Host)

When we do this next year, there'll be like a 32-second clip of his amazing work. He does calligraphy as a performance and it's beautiful to watch and experience.

Alright.

Quick moment of honesty. This work— this event— this community— it stays independent because we all choose to support it.

This is a self-funded community membership. It is not really about perks. We got some, but they're kind of cute. Nobody's actually really claimed them.

You get discounts off tickets, discounts off workshops— really it's about putting our money in the middle and forming something bigger than all of ourselves.

I appreciate everyone in here who's done that. It's 165 people now and people are starting to take notice.

Someone came to me tonight and said they were at a party in Toronto where they heard about this scene as one of the most interesting things going on.

If this ecosystem has helped you, or if you want it to exist next year even stronger, consider becoming a member.

We're doing this founding member drive just till the end of the year, and then things will change a little bit. So get in while you can.

Woo.

Okay. That was the halfway infomercial bit. Now we're onto the good shit.

### Squatchie Award #4: Simon Haworth

**Category:** Life Sciences Innovation & Community Signal

### Kris Krüg (Host)

This one's easy.

We hand these trophies out for a simple reason: the ecosystem runs on the people who share— people who connect dots for others— people who build infrastructure with their time.

**Simon Haworth** is one of those people.

Simon is the CEO of **[company name unclear]**. His world is drug discovery, pharma, health data— regulated life.

And yet Simon has been tracking something wild from the inside and sharing all of it with us.

In about a year, AI went from absent in the drug discovery world to a major contributor— almost every breakthrough. Not theories, not demos— actual work moving forward.

When Simon says stuff, it lands differently because he's reporting from the inside.

Now zoom out: what makes him a Squatchie winner isn't just what he knows, but what he does with it.

He shows up at our weekly office hours with real intelligence, shares without posturing, connects people into real opportunities— including serious life science players.

And he does it in a way that keeps the doors open for the community instead of just for him and his friends.

He's got that rare combo of being constructive and honest. He'll praise what's working, and he'll tell you how to make it better— usually with a classy grit, British grumpy Brit type of thing— but he's all about care. All about commitment.

This Squatchie is for being a true signal and connector in our community.

Thank you, Simon.

### Simon Haworth

This is what imposter syndrome looks like.

I'm British, so I don't have a sense of humor that you understand. So I'm gonna be serious.

This is a really important time, and these days is what a revolutionary looks like, and that is what a revolutionary looks like.

We are in a revolution. Life sciences in particular is wild right now.

I am going to— don't tell them— ruin the pharmaceutical industry and completely restart it.

The big announcement from us is that we will have a life sciences specialty group starting next year. So anybody interested in drug discovery, development and asset development in life sciences, please connect with me.

Kris told me this evening he had something up his sleeve and he didn't tell me about the haircut, and he's promised not to tell me the name of his barber, but that's the British humor for you that you don't understand.

Kris, it's been an absolutely brilliant time being involved in this.

I joined this as a group that was just peripheral to what I was doing. Although the film and the creativity— it has turned out to be one of the most important ways I've connected with Vancouver as a community.

So thank you.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Thank you, brother. You've done a lot of great work, man.

And we didn't even have our sales and business leader AI upgrade program when Simon took the course— so he took the AI for Creative Pros course as a pharmaceutical CEO and he loved it.

---

### Simon Haworth

I didn't know what I was before I started that course, and I certainly didn't by the time I finished.

### Squatchie Award #5: Udbhav Kansal

**Category:** Applied Innovation & Community Glue

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Home stretch.

This Squatchie is for applied innovation— the kind that survives contact with reality.

**Udbhav Kansal** has been one of the most consistent doers in our whole ecosystem.

He wins hackathons. He performs outreach. He makes introductions. He brings people in. He follows through on everything he says. He turns energy into outcomes.

A lot of you have felt it directly.

He's onboarded you into the association. He's helped you get connected, unblocked. He gets all the right people in the same room.

He also builds— you guys know his claim to fame.

I've been bragging about him for a couple weeks, but he just got back from Paris where he won another hackathon— nine straight podiums in 2025.

The NASA Space Apps Challenge, the Red Thread Club, Canadian Ocean Supercluster hackathon, then the international finals in Paris.

Got euros in the bank.

Udbhav is community glue with a builder's mindset. The combo is rare and it scales people all around him.

Udbhav, thank you for your dedication. Please come grab your award.

---

### Udbhav Kansal

Thank you.

I'm kind of emotional and this— I see this as a story of this community.

It's about how each of you, how this community— how Kris, Armen, Hiro, Patrick, Keisha— everybody— has enabled someone like me to achieve greater things consistently.

It's a story of this community support and I'll be forever grateful for that.

Thank you so much.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Would you just hold that for a second and just come stand here with me for a second?

Udbhav is so incredibly humble as you just witnessed that.

I've never felt the need to toot somebody's horn harder than this guy because he does such incredible work and he is always there and he would never do it himself.

I'm making him extremely uncomfortable, and that's okay.

You still have a mic— jump in at any point.

---

### Udbhav Kansal

All I feel right now— and for the entirety of 2025— is extreme gratitude for this community, for everything that has come into my life through this community, and all the positivity that has come to me.

This guy pushes me hard— not just here, but other places as well— and it lets me come out of old patterns and habits and I'm exceptionally grateful to him and each one of you.

I wish I could take all the names here, but I can't.

So I'm just gonna thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I hope we grow together and I win more hackathons. I— but yeah— sure.

Seriously.

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Leave some for the rest of us.

Thank you so much.

Alright. This is fun, right?

Thanks. You can fill it out in the feedback form if you didn't like it. Otherwise I'll void it and we're gonna do it again next year.

### Squatchie Award #6 (Paired): Michael Tippett & Kate Armstrong

**Category:** AI-Native Storytelling & Cultural Leadership

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Alright. Tonight— this is the last one, and it's a special one. It's a pair tonight.

One of the things I wanna honor is a very specific kind of builder— the people who not just make work, they make room for the whole room to exist. Room for experimentation, language, collaboration, and creative risks.

This goes out to two people who've been doing it in Vancouver for a long time and who are now helping define what AI-native storytelling could become.

**Michael Tippett** is building AI-native film and series infrastructure from the ground up through **Generation Studios** and other things.

He's pushing new production paradigms that treats stories as something alive— building tools, exploring memory-to-cinema flows, developing a slate that's genuinely future-facing and flexible— open and built in public.

What I respect most, Mike, is your community citizenship. You're always checking in on the channels, dropping shit first for us, getting our feedback and taking it out there into the world.

I love being part of your prototyping development cycle. You incorporate feedback. I saw you do that today with Brian Hawken's team where you were like, "You're right. You should be able to sort and slice and dice that. Go hit refresh. I just added that feature."

When he ships something meaningful, he brings it to our community early— not as marketing, but as a real request for feedback from his peers.

Thank you, Mike.

And before you come up—

**Kate Armstrong** is one of the clearest minds in this space. Curator, writer, artist, connector.

She speaks to the questions that have kept creative work honest, and builds context that helps artists and builders understand what we're actually doing.

She's the intellectual and creative force that keeps this whole conversation honest.

She writes and curates at the intersection of culture and technology and power.

She builds context for creators and she asks the questions that make our work better.

Together, they bridge film and tech, practice and critique, Vancouver and the big wide world.

Michael Tippett, Kate Armstrong— come on up. Grab a Squatchie.

---

### Kate Armstrong

Oh no— I never give up both mics. Who's gonna stop them?

Ladies first?

Oh my God. Thank you so much.

You have no idea how touching this is for me. This is such an amazing community.

Whenever I come to any of these gatherings, I realize how connected everybody is to each other and to other communities, and how much this is a node of super-connection around this subject that is as yet undefined other than its connection to creativity and AI, and there's so much excitement in that.

For me, the fact that you have brought this to us— especially in partnership with— like my husband—

---

### Michael Tippett

We're dating, we're—

---

### Kate Armstrong

—and with such beautiful style and focus and such an incredible community is really awesome.

So thank you. It's very, very appreciated. Thank you.

---

### Michael Tippett

Yeah, this is really— it's weird. It's weird to get an award with your wife. But cool. Thank you. Thank you.

Weird but cool.

I just wanted to be on record saying: I like the haircut. I like it. I like it.

And I've seen all his haircuts because I've known him for like 20 years. All of them. Like I knew when he had normal hair.

I just— you know— on that note: thank you to Kris and recognition of Kris for his contribution to this community over the years.

I can say that as someone who's known him for 20— we shared an office 20 years ago.

We were at the Vice party at South by, and I think we got kicked out of a hotel in Las Vegas many years ago. We've had some stories.

But we didn't burn it down and that's what matters.

---

### Kate Armstrong

We didn't. Yeah. It's still there.

---

### Michael Tippett

Kris has been an innovator and a leader in the technology sector in this region since Northern Voice and way back— early days of blogging, early days of social.

I was at Hootsuite and Kris was a pioneer in that space and continues to contribute to the community.

So thank you to you and your whole team here for all you guys have done. It's really amazing.

## Closing

### Kris Krüg (Host)

Alright. Who made these gorgeous trophies?

---

### [Unclear speaker]

Benson Awards in Vancouver?

---

### Kris Krüg (Host)

I'm glad you like them. They're fabulous.

Congratulations, guys.

Before I let you guys bounce— we've got special cookies made by Noah and Eliza at **Slap Treats**. We've got the bar open again. Peter's gonna be hustling you down trying to get you into some workshops.

I'm gonna be out back smoking a cigar, but before we let you go—

This community ain't just a vibe, it's a practice. It's a room we build together month after month by showing up with generosity and high standards.

The Squatchies aren't a finish line. They're a signal flare. A way of us telling people that we're doing the real work and that we see you.

Keep going, and none of us are alone. We're in this together.

If you met someone here tonight you respect, follow up with them in the next 24 hours. If you learn something, share it forward.

And if you want to keep this thing going independently, join us as a member.

Thank you very much. 2025 was awesome. I cannot wait to see you.

I'll eat a taco for each one of you in Mexico.

Thank you, man. Is there anything I forgot?

Alright, class dismissed.

Thanks, everybody.
