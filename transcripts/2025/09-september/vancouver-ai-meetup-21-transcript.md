## Opening

**Kris Krüg:** Hey, welcome everybody to Vancouver AI meetup number 21. Thank you very much for coming. You are the Vancouver AI community. I'm really excited to see everybody. It's a really big week in AI right now. A lot of people have been talking about it. There's UBC's Immersion Week going on. There was a Vancouver Entrepreneur Forum AI event going on this week. 125 people from our BC AI community are in Montreal right now. There's a big sovereign AI Canadian conference going on with Minister Evan Solomon and Minister Rick Mack.

So there's a lot of stuff going on right now and I really appreciate you guys carving out your time to be here with each other and with me. I love doing this, so thank you very much for being here. I'm excited to kick us off tonight with my buddy jonny williams from the Squamish Nation.

## Squamish Welcome - jonny williams

**jonny williams:** [In Squamish language] My name's Jonathan Williams, though my mom's the only one who called me that. Everyone else just called me Johnny. I come from the Squamish reservation, also known as North Yards, in the Squamish Valley. I left at like five twenty and I still didn't get here on time. I got stuck on that bridge traffic for 45 minutes.

I'm a Squamish Nation member. I'm actually running in our nation elections right now. The vote day will be on the 28th. Hopefully I'm elected. We shall see. I said in my heart, I'm a respectful person or I believe to be a respectful person in my heart. I'm grateful for all you guys that are here today. Thanks to Cha, our creator, for the beautiful day.

I was always taught we're supposed to start an event in a good way. A good way for us is either through a prayer or through song. I'll be sharing a song known as the Chief Song. This song was sung by one of the first coalitions of counselors of the Squamish Nation after amalgamation in the 1920s.

There was a group of 16 chiefs that went over to England. They paid for the whole process themselves. In the story that I heard, they sung this song because they weren't allowed to go into the castle at first. But after they sung this song, the Queen realized that we are humans too. She realized that we weren't just savages. In this song, when we raise our hands like this, it's a thank you, but it's also a welcome.

[Song performance]

**jonny williams:** I first met Kris Krüg when I went on a canoe journey from Squamish all the way to Bella Bella. We canoed for 23 days straight, 600 nautical miles, day after day. Sometimes we'd get in at 11 o'clock at night and leave the first time at 3:00 AM and he was our support boat the whole way.

When he told about the event to my parents, I was interested personally because I used AI in my work. When I was working as a cultural advisor for the rights and title department for the Squamish Nation, I did a lot of document readings. I worked on a lot of different official community plans. They're often 200, 250, maybe 300 pages. I personally only looked at them for the cultural aspect.

I've worked with an AI personally on things that I wrote and information that I put in through Squamish information that I've learned as a cultural advisor. Since I've added the information and corrected it, it made my job a lot easier. It would point me to the places that I have to look at and then things that I should comment on. Now I use AI a lot for my pamphlets and my posters and my presentations for my candidacy. It just comes up a lot more concise than what I'm able to put on the paper.

**Kris Krüg:** Johnny, your AI story is one of my favorite AI stories of all time. Johnny speaks the Squamish language. He's one of a new group of Squamish speakers that have been trained, but there's just a handful of Squamish speakers left.

**jonny williams:** There's about 10 from the old generation. There's like five fully fluent Squamish speakers. Then there's a lot of speakers like myself who speak like adolescent or a child level. So you're able to ask a specific amount of questions and be able to understand a lot, but you don't have a very big vocabulary. After I was part of the first cohort, they've now done four or five cohorts, so there's about 60 or 70 of us now who have come to be speakers.

**Kris Krüg:** Check this out. There's five original language fluent speakers. There's 60 new generation speakers and AI allowed him to go from being a document parser to being a cultural advisor. He's like, dude, I can't even find the parts in the PDFs. I'm like one of the only people that speaks the language left on this planet. They want my advice on this thing and I can't even find the parts. So now he drops like 10 PDFs in on Monday, pulls all the paragraphs he needs to consult on, and gets to go about his business being a cultural advisor. Pretty fricking amazing, dude.

**jonny williams:** One more thing I always forget to mention: what we now call Greater Vancouver, the word in our language is Kamala. What that translates to is the place of lots of maples. Before there was lots of buildings, lots of roads, there was a lot of nature. The way we often choose our words or create our words is describing what is happening in the place. You don't often name things after people or things.

**Kris Krüg:** Thank you Johnny. We all spend a lot of time talking about AI alignment, keeping the human in the thing. Us starting off with Johnny sharing a bit of his story and his song and ceremony here is a chance for us to kind of all get on the same page, to put this stuff first as we go down in our geeky rabbit holes and explore this AI stuff.

## Video Message from Dave Olson (Uncle Weed)

**Kris Krüg:** There's a whole bunch of people that have been participating in this event from abroad. One of my old mentors and friends, Dave Olson from Japan made us a little video tonight.

**Dave Olson (video):** Hello, the Vancouver AI Meetup #21. This is Dave Olsen coming to you from Sita Cottage, Kaama Japan with a friendly greeting. I am very grateful to be able to tap into your conversations, hear all your unique voices, and the freeform flow like some kind of punk rock jam band jazz.

I want to say a special thank you to all of you who are doing the work, documenting through photos, videos, and especially podcasts. These are very important and very helpful for shut-ins and those folks who have a hard time getting out to events like this.

I have participated in many communications revolutions from mimeograph newsletters to zines, to chapbooks, to dial up modem ISPs, to notable campaigns and companies in Vancouver, Olympia and other Coast Salish territories. Over that time, I've learned a couple things. The top three are: go out, gather stories and share with interestingness. Two, always be archiving 'cause the internet has a very short memory. And three, always be kind 'cause you never know who you're gonna meet on your journey. This includes feeding your robots endless goodness. If they're gonna stick around with us for a while, we might as well teach them to be a little bit empathetic and kind and curious.

To those of you I know, it is such a delight to hear so many familiar voices. And to those of you I have yet to meet, I send fond greetings and best wishes. Thank you for the prayers, the pods, and the candor, fondly from Sida Cottage.

**Kris Krüg:** Listen, AI doesn't have to look like Silicon Valley. It doesn't have to look like Mark Zuckerberg. It does not have to look like Elon Musk. It can look like jonny williams. It can look like Uncle Weed here. This guy's the biggest archivist I know. He's got 25 years of pods and vlogs and blogs that he's meticulously kept. So he's now applying agents and assistance in a way that has amplified his reach in a super incredible way. I'm offering you tonight a whole bunch of different perspectives on what AI can look like in our world so that we don't all have to do the Silicon Valley Theater.

## Data Story Hackathon - Julia and Dale (Rival Technologies)

**Kris Krüg:** Don't snooze on this. We have given away $7,500 in the last couple months through our hackathon, and we've got another one in the middle right now. It's sponsored by Rival Technologies. Dean Shev won last month for a really cool album. Matt Sinclair won the month before for a Canadian identity simulator. Sev Kin won the first month and also got nominated into the Hall of Fame for his AGI data interface thing. I just hired him for a project I work on at the Indi Genomics Institute.

Who's downloaded the data set so far? [About 10 people raise hands] We got a new data set on our GitHub.

**Julia:** We're on round four now. This round is music themed. We asked a thousand Canadians from the Angus Reid Forum all about their opinions on how they find music today, what their favorite artists are, what their guilty pleasures are. The deadline is October 15th.

**Brett:** The sky's the limit, really. Everyone is different. Everyone's looking and interpreting data differently. We all talk different. We all take in information differently. That's what we're looking for—use who you are to interpret what the data is saying. It's representative of Canada, so go for it. Just have fun.

**Kris Krüg:** If you've never done a hackathon before, this is a really unique opportunity. The very first step is just download the data set and stick it in ChatGPT and be like, "what the fuck is in all these surveys?" Then if it says something back interesting to you, follow it down that rabbit hole. I've developed like 10 or 12 projects based on this data set already.

Winner gets $2,500 bucks, but all the winner's circle gets taken out for a really fancy dinner. First time Andrew took us to a fancy restaurant. Second time he got his boat out of the yacht club, took us over to Bowen Island. Worst case scenario, you make an awesome project, you get to go out with all the cool kids for dinner.

Also, I know a lot of you guys are trying to get jobs. The number one thing I could tell people about penetrating the resume stack is having extracurricular activities that you're awesome at. If your MBA application is next to 500 other MBA applications, the person who's got a hackathon win on the bottom of their resume stands out.

**ByteDance Hackathon Announcement:**

It's kind of bad luck to talk about something before the ink is fully dry, but this has been a catalyst for us getting into the hackathon community space. We have a major tier one partner, international partner at the table. It's ByteDance. We have approval in principle to do a video and photo hackathon here with a $20,000 US prize on November 16th and 17th.

So it's not fully announced yet. This is the foreshadowing. I tried to get the contract done tonight. But very likely you're gonna be seeing some surprising awesome things in terms of financial support from some major international companies around this community.

## Mind, AI & Consciousness (MAC) Group - Danny

**Kris Krüg:** We got a bunch of people in Montreal right now including our fearless leader of the Mind AI and Consciousness Group, Loki Jorgenson. But Loki has asked Danny to share a little bit about our MAC group.

**Danny:** Hi everyone, my name is Danny. We gather every month to talk about the intersection of consciousness and AI. How can we use this new technology to understand what's happening inside of our heads and in our experience as humans? Sometimes the conversation is more philosophical and sometimes it's more related to new discoveries in science and technology.

In the last deep dive, we had an expert that works in the intersection of quantum computers, AI and consciousness. Her name is Suzanne Gilbert. Part of her theory is trying to see if there's a part of our consciousness that comes from quantum mechanics. She says that there is a part of us that is more automatic, more programmatic, which is similar to computers. And there's part of us that actually has some agency, and in this agency is where we can find consciousness. She's trying to bring this part of agency that comes from the quantum realm to robots, trying to figure out if this is the way to give robots agency, therefore consciousness.

That was mind blowing to me. We do these types of conversations. It's great. You don't need any type of expertise. I'm a designer, so I'm trying to follow these conversations, but we do have big brains there. Some people come from tech, some people come from science. We're always looking for someone new, always looking for diversity.

We're about a hundred people now. We gather in groups of 20. There's a WhatsApp group where we share information. We do have to do a lot of reading before each gathering. The next one is on October 16th, and it's about: is AI a philosophical zombie?

**Kris Krüg:** One of the things I love most about the Mind AI and Consciousness Group is that it stands in stark contrast to what we're doing here, where everyone's welcome, bar's as low as it can be. This group is like, "I'm sorry, sir, have you done your readings?" And then they give you a pop quiz at the door about some existential next level stuff.

I've actually found it a really useful peer accountability group because I can't actually show up unless I've done all the readings and watched all the videos. I'm even working on a personal research paper around aesthetic taste and if we could use aesthetic taste as a way to potentially determine if there is consciousness inside of AIs or not. Because it seems like attraction and understanding for art and beauty is something that is uniquely human. Maybe we could use this as a rubric to test new consciousnesses as we come in contact with them.

## Vancouver AI Meetup at Northeastern - Elena

**Elena:** Hi everyone. I'm Elena. I'm co-creating an upcoming Vancouver AI meetup with Professor Isam Haddad. It's on October 18. We're hosting a special gathering called "AI Beyond the Algorithm: Power, Psyche, and the Future of Human Agency." We'll be joined by incredible speakers including Kris Krüg and Dr. Philip from SFU. We'll also have a local developer demo how to run LLMs privately. Big emphasis on how to ensure privacy when you're using models.

**Kris Krüg:** I have so many good things to say about this organization other than their unfortunate name. They are doing amazing learning groups, peer-centered learning. It only costs five bucks to show up. The five bucks is just to make sure that people who indicate they're going actually do show up. But they go deep and Professor Isam shares all sorts of stuff. Him and I share a vision for building a British Columbia Center of Excellence in AI.

Philippe, who's also speaking with me at that event—a lot of you guys know him. He runs the Meta Creation Lab for Creative AI at the School of Interactive Art and Technology, SFU Surrey. Big contributor here. He was presenting at Ars Electronica a paper that five of us in this room have written: AIA, Leonel, Moham, Philippe and myself. That paper just got second place at Ars Electronica, honorable mention. It's fucking awesome.

It's a generative creativity article about using GANs—generative adversarial networks—including the open source tool Autoloom that we've built at the Meta Creation Lab to build small models based on artists' work without dipping into the training data that has been stolen from all the artisans of mankind. Philippe's Lab just won second place at like the world's biggest international AI creativity conference.

## Community Announcements

**Carly Steinman - Tradeswoman Exhibition:**
Hi friends. My name is Carly Steinman. I am a licensed electrician entrepreneur and I've been in the industry for 19 years. I did a photo shoot of 19 Tradeswomen and I applied to art galleries. I have an exhibition next month from October 18th to November 1st. I'm doing a home maintenance 101 workshop as a pilot to launch WorkBee, which is a business that's gonna take care of our aging population who are living independently. Please follow Lady Electric.

ChatGPT has helped me as an entrepreneur build this pilot and imagine and not only imagine, but actually have the courage to create and do it. Chat's my assistant and I wouldn't be able to execute without that.

**Matthew Schwartzman - Surrey AI Meetup:**
I run the Surrey AI Community Meetup. We meet in South Surrey. It's a smaller community, so you kind of get to meet everybody. We also have speakers kind of the same as here, but just smaller. Come find me, I'll give you a code for some percent off.

**Kris Krüg:** This legion has a tiny restaurant in the back with three grandmas that run it. Everything there is homemade including desserts. They had coconut cream pie, lemon freeze thing, three grandma desserts I had never had. They give you a food voucher when you buy a ticket. So half the ticket price goes to a food voucher, you get homemade food. It's really sweet.

**Armand - Education + AI Meetup:**
Hi, I am Armand. This is my third meetup. I went to the education meetup with Anthonia at the Ethos Labs. I gotta tell you, it was so inspiring. The conversation had actionable insights. If you're into education, educating people in any way, whether it's young people or older people, or if you give a fuck about the whole paradigm of education—it was really cutting edge conversation. The next one's happening October 9th.

**James Lester - Sons of Vancouver Distillery:**
I've been reading a lot of biographies lately. I think you should all go out and pick up a copy of "Creativity Inc." by Ed Catmull. He started Pixar. There's like two or three avenues of creativity. There's constructive where you're putting things together to build something. You're going up a mountain, you're in a tunnel and you know there's an end in sight.

The next one is reductive, where you have a block of marble and the perfect statue is in there somewhere, and you need to remove the parts that are not the statue. The people who I've met that are the most creative recognize these two sides and walk between them when they need them. The third method is the Jackson Pollock method. You're throwing shit at a wall. I've seen varying degrees of success. Take this one at your own risk.

**Marius - Sege Law:**
My name is Marius. I'm a partner at Sege LLP. We're a law firm. We do a ton of work with startups, AI companies. We understand the challenges we face. We work with companies of all sizes. If you have questions about legal stuff, come find me after.

**Dimitri Schwartzman - Real Estate & AI:**
I'm learning about AI. I'm trying to develop an app. I help a lot of single families to buy and sell properties. I use AI to export files and do very deep research on properties that are better, that are more valuable, that have better chances of being sold down the road. The capabilities of AI are incredible and real estate really needs it to improve videos, research and much more.

**Kris Krüg:** He's being kind of coy. He developed a super secret prompt he's been working on over the last year that is able to identify the lowest price per square foot based on parameters in a whole area. So if you want some strategic intelligence on cheap property that's good value, talk to Dmitri.

## BC AI Discord Launch - Gabriel Zaro

**Kris Krüg:** I'm super stoked to introduce you guys to Gabe Zaro. This guy's a fucking rockstar. Zaro is a community executive, CEO level community guy. He's worked for a lot of the coolest projects in the whole wide world when it comes to community. Him and I are working on the BC AI Discord. He flips me a screenshot yesterday from his archives—the last Discord server he set up had like 52,000 people online. We're talking EA Sports, soccer, basketball type game stuff. He's a community genius.

**Gabriel Zaro:** I have a very eclectic background. I've been collecting communities for about 40 years. I've been to theater, music, religion, circus, tech, marketing, design, politics, gaming and AI. At some point I was even part of a magic and illusionism association. [Does magic trick] Nothing in this hand. And nothing in this hand.

I have a hypothesis that I'm working on: that community is humanity's operating system. I was born in the very edges of a community—the second biggest favela in Brazil, a place where 120,000 people still live to this day. Very humble background. That's where I learned to see how people treat each other. In a favela, in the community, your neighbor is your babysitter, is your grocery store, is your alarm system. Ignore them at your own risk. But from chaos you are able to get some sort of organic organization. From that chaos you get trust. That was my patch zero for my operating system: survival.

I went into the circus. Working in the circus is really weird because at one point I was holding myself by a rope in a 40-foot structure. The only thing making me safe was my friends on the other end. If I let go, they would fall. If they let go, I would fall. Circus is really weird that way because it's the only interviewing process that can leave a very noticeable stain. That was the security patch. That's where I learned to trust and work with a team.

Moving forward, I went into gaming, worked for EA on FIFA, then worked on 2K. Those are big ones. The thing I learned there is that community for those companies used to be a reactive discipline. We came in and created intelligence out of those. That's what we're trying to do here for BC AI. We have a very interesting community with very different eclectic backgrounds.

For that we're doing a survey to help matchmake and find good matches for the people who are here. So if you're a founder, if you're an investor, if you're looking for someone to do a project with, this is what we're gonna work for right now. So we're opening this survey, and with it we're opening a Discord server.

Conversations so far have happened in WhatsApp groups, and those are cool and great, but it just gets overwhelming. So the Discord comes in to help with that. I wanna show you the onboarding so you guys are not overwhelmed when you join.

[Demonstrates Discord onboarding process with customization questions about interests, SIGs, location, and rules]

As soon as you join, you're asked three questions. First: what are your main interests? As you select the interests, you get a different experience within the server. Second: what SIGs or special interest groups are you interested in participating in? You saw about MAC, Ed+AI, and all the other ones we're working on. Third: where you're from—helps us understand where we wanna do events next.

The cool thing about Discord is perma links. So we set up forum channels. Sometimes we start a conversation on WhatsApp, "Oh, did you see this paper that just came out?" Then like 140 messages come after that. You come in after a Saturday and you're like, "What the hell just happened here?" With Discord and forum channels, you'll always have a perma link. We can start a conversation today about a paper, and two years from now when that paper gets updated, we go back to that same discussion and we don't lose it. There's a search engine within it so you can actually find these conversations.

We're also rolling out the survey. It's an onboarding survey. This one will take you about 10 minutes. It's a little deeper, but it goes into the details of what you're looking for in this community. This is where we're gonna matchmake you and actually create a data set of everybody in BC AI.

**Kris Krüg:** Like matchmaking sounds kind of bullshit a lot of times, but you guys know, you all come to me and you're like, "Who should I talk to in this room? Who knows about AI ethics?" This matchmaking thing is just a way of systematizing what you guys are already asking me for all the time, which is connecting you to the right people in the room.

## Keynote Introduction - Jesse from 221A

**Jesse (221A):** Thanks Kris Krüg. Long time observer, but first time meetup. So 221A—we're an artist organization, cultural organization. We've got about nine facilities across the city, mostly supporting studio spaces, galleries, cultural spaces, education spaces. Ethos Lab is in one of our buildings.

I'm the head of digital strategy, so we've been moving into digital infrastructure and thinking about what that means. We're on a FAIR data mission. FAIR is an acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data. That's what we need to be doing with our cultural data. Give it identity, give it transactional capacity, give it rights, let it live in the world, let the robots do what they wanna do with it. We're really kind of AI positive in that space.

One of the things we're doing is building a partnership with an accelerator program called Brink. We're just about to announce our first cohort for a FAIR Data accelerator group. That should come out sometime in October. There'll be future cohorts if you've got ideas and projects to pitch. That's usually somewhere between $150K to $250K preseed funding to get your project going, and then they've got a global syndicate to hook you up after that.

The reason I wanted to come to the event tonight was to share Manuel's project. Manuel Axelstrain, all pronouns, is a two-spirit artist from the lands and the waters of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh people. Their practice braids family memory, land-based ceremony, and anti-colonial aesthetics to reimagine how we relate across beings and systems. Please join me in welcoming Manny to the stage.

## Keynote: AI and Indigenous Knowledge - Manuel Axelstrain

**Manuel Axelstrain:** Thank you, Jesse. Hello everyone. [Speaks in Halkomelem] I just said in the downriver dialect of Halkomelem my name and that I'm from Squamish and Halkomelem territories. Where we are today is near a place called Chaythoos. Chaythoos has been the name of this place for a long time. Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh people have traveled and used this area for a long time.

I'm very grateful to be here today. I'm an artist. I work with all sorts of different mediums. I'm also the co-artistic director of the Vines Art Society. Today I'm here to share my idea with you all and see if anyone can help. 'Cause I need all the help to do this. It's a rather ambitious project.

I'm gonna share with you some very sacred information and knowledge. What we're seeing today, especially here in the context of this unsettled, unseated land, is a resurgence of indigenous knowledge systems. In addition, we're having this sort of new moment of this AI revolution. So these moments are happening together at the same time.

But what's really interesting is that when I was thinking about indigenous knowledge systems, it's almost like we have to go back. We have to remember who we are and where we come from. But AI is asking us to go to places we haven't been. So that's what I'm contending with—that binary system of going back and going forward, the past and the future, working together.

**[Discussing his art exhibition at Richmond Art Gallery]**

I'll start with this first image. It's an installation at Richmond Art Gallery. I have a solo exhibition there. This is a painting, an oil painting on a wall that I painted a mural on, and I did use AI to create some of the imagery. These forms are based off of images of a compound called Paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is found in yew trees and it's actually in chemotherapy as well.

So using AI to find out what are the specific unique medicinal qualities of the plants that are indigenous here, and then making images off them. The work is called "Together with Paclitaxel." I'm asking us to be together with the land and the micro elements of that land.

This image is called "Lithium Over a Forest Fire." I was using AI to help find images of lithium under a microscope, then making pictographic images within the style of the Columbia River pictographs. My messaging here is that we have these ecological crises that we're going through like forest fires, and at the same time we're having a rise in mental health crisis and a toxic drug supply crisis. All issues with the mind.

What I'm trying to say is that what we're experiencing in the climate is also what humans are going through because I'm trying to get us to remember that we are part of the land and we are part of this ecosystem. We cannot separate ourselves from it. Everything on this earth is together. So when we have these crises in the ecosystem, humans are gonna feel that at our core as well.

**[Discussing plant communication]**

This one is called "Micro Medicine." I was looking at the mycelium network that trees use to communicate to each other. We know now that trees send warning signals to each other and they work together to warn each other or communicate. Using AI, I was looking at different images based on that mycelium network. I put an image of my grandma because we believe as Coast Salish people that our ancestors are really connected to the cedar tree.

That's because a long time ago when we died, they would go into the tree. In the interior, on my mother's side of the family, they would bury a loved one with a tree. The trees recycle air as well and help us in that sense.

What's been taught to me from my uncle Shane, who's an elder in our family, is that everything is medicine. You just have to know how to use it. Everything you're touching right now comes from the earth, but we as humans forget that. This revitalization of indigenous knowledge is teaching us to go back and remember who we are and where we come from.

**[The vision for plant communication]**

My uncle Neil Ash once was talking to me on a video chat. He said, "I want to be able to actually know what the tree is saying and I want to be able to connect to it at that level." We, as First Nations people, have always known that we can communicate with trees and that they communicate to each other.

Whenever we're struggling, it's been taught to me and many other First Nations, especially Coast Salish people, to go spend time with a tree and you listen and the tree will tell you things.

It's funny 'cause I was talking to my dad about this idea. I said, "What if we have to find a way to get people to understand what these plants and animals and the trees are saying?" He looked at me, he said, "You know, that tree's just gonna tell you to fuck off, right?" [Laughter]

But he's the one that taught me to just, if you ever need to get energy from a tree, you just go and you put your hands on it and you just sit there and sit with it. So I'm hoping that all of us here can start to understand our interconnectedness and dependency on the forest. We are dependent upon it and we will need it. We need to boost its communication to us.

It's also been taught to me growing up that plants will communicate to us through dreams. If you spend enough time with plants and you connect in a certain way, it'll come to you in a dream and it will start talking to you. I've experienced this myself. It's very strange to see the plant. It's just bizarre. But this is knowledge that we have safeguarded for a long time. I think we were afraid to share it with you all because we thought you would think we're crazy. But it is real.

We're now learning—everyone knows now—if you talk to a plant, it grows better. There's even stories of us, and it's still done to this day, that when we go into the land and we harvest a plant, we have to talk to it, and we have to even sing to it. We offer it something.

At the exhibition at Richmond Art Gallery, for four nights I would gather wild flowers at nighttime, and I asked them to help me. I would sit with the plants and I would say, "Please help me. Our world is divided, and I need your help to remind people of the beauty of our world and how to relate to each other better."

When you start to connect with them in that way, you feel the burden of them, the burden of taking them and asking for their help. It's kind of like going to your parents and being like, "Mom and dad, can you help me?"

**[Creation story and the vision]**

Our creation story is that we all descend from the sky. The Coast Salish version is that when we descended from the sky, there was this figure called Xals the Transformer. To teach humans a lesson, he turns some people into rocks, into animals, and into plants. So we literally acknowledge that we're all connected. When you think about life on this earth, we all came from this single cell that first started.

That's really the main purpose here: to show that First Nations people have a story that can help humanity as a whole, if we can start to honor and respect the integrity and intelligence of what we're trying to share.

My uncle Neil Ash was like, "I wanna talk to a tree." I've been told my whole life, you gotta talk to the plants before you take from them. It was pretty late at night and I was here with Will. I just said, "I want to know what that tree is saying to that tree." We just used AI to sort of create that dialogue.

Then from there I started thinking there has to be a way for us to actually do this. If we can get it right and understand the communication and how we as humans interact with it better, the possibilities to regenerate forests could really help us. Because if we know that if you sing to the plants they'll grow better, then we can have a lot of us together, a lot of humans in the forest singing together, and that will help regenerate the forest better, which can help all of us.

I'm talking about dreaming with plants and singing to the forest and it'll grow better. But this is all starting to be proven by science, what we've known since forever.

**[Technical approach]**

What me and Will were working on: there's all these different chemicals that plants use to communicate with each other. There have been studies of how these different networks can communicate to each other, but kind of focusing on one thing at a time, like the fungal network, for example.

What I'm hoping to achieve is that over time we can use all the different ways that plants communicate to each other together and focus on that. But what I need help understanding is, first we'll have to work with small samples of plants, and then we'll have to sing to them, see how they respond to the growth. We'll have to understand how they respond to that. So we'll have to develop a mechanism to interpret the data, to give us a message.

Can that be translated into human speech? I'm not sure. Or English is a major question. But this is what I've been dreaming about with AI.

## Q&A with Manuel and Will

**Will:** I get to call myself a puzzler as many of you are collecting your knowledge and your experience. When Manny was telling me about the idea, I kinda stopped him and said, "Gimme 30 seconds"—you're onto something.

How many different ways are there that plants talk? Now you start looking into taxonomies and the structure of data. As soon as you start expanding out any sort of idea above 12 or 16, you wanna start looking for multiple categories. We've had about nine different sciences. And the one thing about sciences—they don't communicate very well between each other.

Although individual fields have been explored within realms of understanding what messages are being sent and what that message means, nobody's actually brought it together. So we started building a taxonomy list using AI, and it's getting extensive. We're looking at some of the categories getting 10,000 different options.

You start with the field of science and you get to nine layers later, the message of "Hey, I need more water." That's really where Manny was getting at. We plugged it in on a forest walk and took two pictures of two different bushes, one indigenous and one not. It was quite funny. The non-indigenous one is like, "Well, I just thought I would grow everywhere because it was so boring before I came along."

But if there are tools that can help people get more connected to nature, is that not a good thing?

**Kris Krüg:** What do you need right now? What would be most valuable if somebody was interested in exploring this with you?

**Manuel:** Well, all partnerships are welcome. We have a phrase in our language: "All are welcome." To do this research we will need sensors to connect, to understand the plants, ones that are non-invasive. Anyone that can help us understand the signals better, and funding support as well.

**Kris Krüg:** We ain't necessarily the ballers in the room, but we have access to those people. When you're looking for grant partners, people to talk to about projects, maybe you talk to Will, maybe you talk to Manny. These are the types of things that probably have a lot of legs behind them. How do we get ahold of you?

**Manuel:** I have a website, just my name: manuelaxelstrain.com. There's a contact button there.

**Larissa Healey:** Manny and I know each other back from the day from doing Canada 150. We did a giant mural together and he was the loveliest person you could ever meet. So inspiring to see you here doing this level work. I'd like to collaborate with you again.

**Audience member (film lighting):** I feel like so many times I was like, "Well, you just need to take psilocybin to talk to the plants." But I've got a film lighting company. We actually designed a technology for the film industry and one of the products we made is called the Hypha. It is because hypha is that mycelium network that allows nature to talk. This allows all forms of lighting data to pass through it. So it was just funny how that connection was there. I'm in the middle of trying to hire a new electronics hardware developer. We might be able to help out with microcontrollers.

**Kris Krüg Lag Carpenter:** Hey Manny, good to see you here. Lobbying a bit of an indigenous question at you: one of the hard things as indigenous folks is there's protocol, rules, regulations around how we use and deploy our knowledge, whether that's story, song, dance, painting. That's kind of like a massive question when we're working with AI. What are the kind of ethics or protocols that you're following when you're putting your work out there into the world, but also into AI, where there's potential for loss of control?

**Manuel:** It's a major question. I have done an exhibition about this topic itself. It was called "Threshold" in 2023. It is true that as First Nations people, our intelligence has been appropriated, misused in harmful ways. If it's not delivered in the right way, then that's how we get these appropriations or misunderstandings or confusions. So with AI it is hard.

Generally I just sit with the elders that I know in my family. Shane Point is the elder I consult with usually about these. He basically just said, "Well, we need everyone. We need everyone to help. This is what young people need to do, is we have to find a way to make this work."

Because the other ethical concern that I thought about with this knowledge extraction: if we're left out of these conversations, does that do us more harm?

**Will:** When does it become a responsibility where you can blockchain the actual information that we traditionally have and we have access through that consulting and permission, but there's also general information that stimulates the idea to get there?

**Manuel:** It's a very good important topic. I've actually just programmed most of my AI to have these things in consideration. So there are times where I just ask it and it'll point blank just tell me, "I cannot tell you that." It can be done. It's quite an easy adjustment—to just ask it to follow UNDRIP and follow consent. And it will just point blank tell you, "I can't tell you that."

**Kris Krüg:** I really appreciate this conversation. This qualifies as difficult conversation. I'm the CTO at the Indi Institute with Carol Ann Hilton, and we're often talking about this tension between what we reveal and share, the tools we use and protocol versus being left behind from all of this stuff. This is the most important conversation in many ways and I appreciate you having it.

**Audience member (commons/watershed):** Not long ago I helped the government of BC determine the dollar value of the commons. One of the problems we have as a species is the tragedy of the commons—there are resources in society that are ephemeral but have value. But because they are ephemeral, no one has responsibility for them. I developed a logic tree to express the value and desire of that relationship. That's being used by a local government to invest in watershed assets now. That nature of desire, that attraction between trees and humans and everyone else—I think there's something in there that might help you.

**Audience member (intention vs communication):** I love the work. It's beautiful. But there is a difference between communication and intention. I want you to comment on how do you measure intention? Because conversation can be very different from what you actually intend. Nature is pretty straightforward, but we're not. How do you navigate that?

**Manuel:** Intention is an incredibly important discussion. What wasn't shared and I wish was shared more: when we as Coast Salish people do our welcomings and we welcome people here, traditionally how it's done is you would all have a speaker here and you would approach us and you would tell us your intentions, and then we would say, "Okay, sounds good."

Now it's kind of become this thing where we're like, "Everyone's welcome." What is unfortunate is that the oral history has taught me that when the settler people came here, they had stated their intentions, but they weren't their true intentions.

This is an issue that Coast Salish people and other Interior Salish people have dealt with since settler people have been here. How do we trust your intentions?

What I've learned is that, yeah, it's true. Intentions don't always matter. When I was thinking through this issue, I asked the AI about this project and I said, "What are the difficulties navigating this?" This was what was brought up: that we can't actually know if what it is saying is real.

To not think of it necessarily as a direct communication, but as like a collection of data—that's one way to think of it. A sample of data that we can try to read. Because anything that we ask it to tell us, there's no real way of us actually knowing if this is real. The trees have a lifespan that could be 2,000 years old.

So it's hard to say, is this like an actual message being received or is this just a micro signal and we don't know the whole message? These are the questions we're trying to figure out.

A lot of it, I would say, knowing that Coast Salish people really value and honor the concept of honesty and respect—intuitively, this is why we have to be the ones that do this, because we value that more than I think a greater society does. We believe people's intentions, and that's why we have all these people from other places here. That's why we have all this beautiful city here, because we just trusted, we just took your word for it, and we still are.

## Closing Remarks

**Kris Krüg:** Thank you Manny. Really appreciate your contribution. I appreciate you being open, coming to us with not your fully baked plan, asking for help. I hope that some of you people follow through with your connections with Manny.

**Jesse:** This is what I love the most about what I do: hearing artists' visions and then finding a community to help raise that vision into reality, just like Manny was saying that we did with this city. Please join us. We're not sure what all the partnerships look like, but it's a really exciting project and beautiful to have it in the lands and waters where we live.

It's reminding me of a couple of projects I've been following: an AI almanac for navigating indigenous territories in what is now called Russia starting back in 2017. Or there's a beautiful project coming out of Germany called Terra Zero, which is a self-managing forest where it manages its own needs. It has a crypto economic background. It can decide to log itself enough to just pay for its maintenance so it won't burn down. If you can think about how these projects could connect with what Manny is building, there's a whole world out there that we can start to connect.

**Kris Krüg:** The curator is earning his keep tonight, contextualizing your project in the whole wide world of what's going on. Thank you so much for coming here, buddy.

How was that for you? You want to talk to non-human beings with AI? It does seem like there's something there. If it's just a bunch of pattern recognition inside data sets and we got big enough data sets, I think we can probably talk to the other kin.

## October 29 AI Film Meetup Announcement

**Kevin (Mr. Pixel Wizard):** I have many hats now. The pseudonyms—I'm gonna have a master prompt for everything here. Hey everyone, if some of you have been following along for a while, I get up to quite a bit in AI film. What we started to discover in AI film is that there is quite the industry blossoming, literally in the past couple of months.

So in the spirit of that, in the spirit of fostering community and creativity, Kris Krüg and I and Patrick at UBC have started to coalesce together. We've been talking about an AI film meetup. We've had a WhatsApp group happening over the past couple of months. We're just shy of a hundred people in there, which is mind blowing to me.

We've got a bunch of funding, really just before the finish line from ByteDance as well as some strategic partnerships. So in the spirit of all this coalescing and the group coming together, we're doing a takeover next month. With the Vancouver International Film Festival and Signals happening in October, we thought we would bookend it with making October a film specialty meetup.

So the first real official AI film meetup is happening right here. **October 29th.** We'll have AI films, we'll have people here. We'll talk about what's the latest and greatest. We'll get behind some of the prompts behind some of those films. And depending if ByteDance happens to come through, we may have something very magical and special.

**Kris Krüg:** Kevin helped make special effects on Dune. Thorn helped make special effects on Avatar. These guys are exploring the edges of AI when it comes to audio, video, special effects stuff. They're literally the bee's knees in the whole wide world, and that's why folks like ByteDance come knocking. This dude flew from Tokyo to last month's meetup to do the deal with us, and he'll be back. He's gonna make everybody's tickets cheaper soon.

## Final Closing

**Kris Krüg:** I really appreciate everyone who showed up. Thank you Zaro, for contributing. Thank you, Manny. Thank you, Jesse.

Michelle Diamond, Victor—come stand next to me. You guys seen our prolific documentation, right? These guys are the best of the best. Seriously, a big part of making community is telling the stories of the people in the community. These guys help do that the best. Michelle and Victor come every month since the beginning. They're my go-to people.

I'm always trying to hustle for Michelle, so she takes over Nook coworking space to do this Christmas studio for Christmas family photos. That's like her jam. She makes like pretty much a hundred grand the next couple months doing this awesome Christmas thing. So book your Christmas family photos with Michelle. She's amazing.

And don't ever call Victor, please. He's mine. Never call Victor, ever. Victor Serbin. V-I-K-T-O-R-S-E-R-B-I-N. Never call him please. You're amazing. Thank you guys. Really appreciate it.
