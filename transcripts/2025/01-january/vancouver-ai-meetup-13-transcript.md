We're here making photos. Sit in the front row.  Get a lot of photos of yourself.  I 

agree. 

Okay, okay, okay. Come on in. Find a seat. Come sit near the front if you feel like it. 

One of the guys that I got talking near the front tonight also teaches a martial arts class at Academy Dweller across the street that starts at 8 o'clock. So I'm trying to get this guy on stage and off to his martial arts class before 8 o'clock. 

Has anyone seen Gabriel George here tonight? 

We're close though.  We're close, we're close.  What's up, Jeff Clark? 

Gabriel George, please report for duty. Gabriel George. 

What's up, Peter? 

Katie. 

Welcome. Come on in, guys. Grab a seat. You're doing 

great.  Okay. Welcome, everybody. Come on in, let's get this thing started here.  Welcome to Vancouver AI meetup number 13, our one year anniversary party.  Yeah!  It's pretty awesome. Thanks for those of you who have been here since the beginning, you know. We started this like a year ago in my studio across town.

It was like 80 of us, um, just getting together to talk about AI and had a vision for what this could become, you know. A big tent of, uh, AI.  Interested people, skeptics, explorers, people trying to understand what the heck is going on out there and be a part of the conversation. And so, um, that is you. You are the people that self selected and come out and I appreciate you responding to the call.

Um, as I mentioned, uh, I got one person who I want to get out of here real quick. And, um, so we do this community announcements thing here at the beginning and I've talked to a bunch of people here tonight. And I've invited them to come up and talk for a minute or two. And I might single out some other people as well along the way.

Um, this is a chance for people who are doing interesting things when it comes to AI, emerging technology, innovation, community here in Vancouver, to just tell you what the heck is going on out there. Um, so first up we got Loki Jorgenson. Yo, Loki, this is, uh, he's teaching a Krabby Bon Bon class across, across, down, uh, in less than an hour.

Um,  I'll just let you do it. And we're not going to wait for Gabriel. He's not here. Would you do a tiny little acknowledgement right now? My buddy Gabriel George is tied up in traffic. Ah, that's unfortunate. I won't get to see him. Um, so I'd like certainly to acknowledge everyone who is here and acknowledge the lands which we are here to play, learn, talk, speak.

And those unceded territories that belong to the nations. that are part, both part of Vancouver area, the Squamish Tsleil Waututh. Um, and we want to make sure that we acknowledge always  what has brought us here as individuals and as a community. And what it is that we can bring to others and always remember community in what we do.

And so I'd like to acknowledge all of you for coming here tonight and for all of those who've been here before us. 

So my name is Loki. As you probably know from Scandinavian mythology, Loki was an agent of change.  He got a bad reputation, you've seen the movies.  The kind of change that I'm involved in is the kind that you're involved in. AI.  In community, in what you do and how you do work, economically, creatively, and personally. 

And what we've acknowledged here in BC is that there is a need for us to come together, for us to do things as a group, to bring all of our talents and capabilities and resources, pool them in order to do something special, something bigger than we can do individually or even in small groups. The work that Kris Krüg is doing, bringing us together here, this is very, very important in building that community.

The kind of work Thank you. That would be appropriate. Acknowledge Kris Krüg at this point. 

Oh, I'm so I'm there. I'll keep it short. Sorry, he's right. He's trying to tell me to keep it short. Um,  I work with, uh, Circle Innovation. We work with companies who are approaching AI adoption, productization, and commercialization.  We're also involved with a larger consortium, including with Kris Krüg and many of you who are probably in this room. 

To bring together the potential for change in the shape of a center for AI here in B. C. 

Keep your ears to the ground. Keep your eyes out. We'll be bringing updates. Others will be bringing updates. It's not just us at Circle. There are many different groups and organizations involved. But I think what we're hearing and seeing is the potential for us to be able to represent who we are in B. C.

's unique terroir  in the form of A. I. and in particular making economic impact, which is top of mind these days.  And to do that through that productivity that small and medium businesses here in, in B. C. are capable of expressing. So, that's just to let you know. I don't have any much more time. I'm going to give it back to him. 

Thank you.  Thanks for coming, man. Loki lives on Vancouver Island. Like I said, he teaches his class at Dwello. So he's over here every Wednesday. Sections off some of his time, comes hang out. He's fighting a good fight for us all. I told you guys for the last few months, from this stage, there's stuff going on.

There's big federal buckets of money available. There's people that are forming consortiums and going after it. And some of it's going to be delivered. And those of you who know me close, who I've invited into my notion, we've got lots of plans for Creative Industries future here in bc, powered by AI Wilson.

Tang's been a voice in that, um, whole thing. The AI and BC folks, um, BC Tech, uh, circle innovation, meta creation lab, UBC's, emerging media lab, all sorts of folks involved.  And, um, yeah. Thanks, Loki, for bringing the good word, for not being a gatekeeper man, and just like, uh, sharing the info, letting people know what's going on, and just inviting people into that whole consortium.

I really appreciate you, dude.  Okay. Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, keep your ear to the ground. Big announcement soon. Um, yeah.  Alright, community announcements. Brittney Smaila, who you guys probably know helps organize this thing, she also is going to be doing some poetry later. She works at COGS, uh, the School of Cognitive Systems at UBC.

And, um, Brittany, you're not in here, are you? I am. Oh, great.  Um, uh, Brittany just started a new class at UBC. And knowing that the students are going to be all hip to AI and using AI, she's kind of hacking the classroom in terms of challenging them with their relationship to AI. And I just wanted to give her like a minute to talk about your little experiment you're running in your classroom. 

Thanks. 

Okay. Uh, well, I'll start this with, I probably wouldn't have done this had I not taken Uh, let me plug it here, Kris Krüg's six week class. Um, but, because I had, uh, and I was designing the, uh, curriculum for COGS 401, it's a seminar class, and I have guest speakers come in, uh, and speak to the students, and they each provide an article, um, typically scientific research, but COGS is an interdisciplinary program, uh, philosophy, psychology, computer science, and linguistics.

And with those research articles, The historic assignment has been to summarize them and I don't really care if students can summarize an article.  That's not what I want them to get. I want them to leave there with better, better critical thinking skills than they entered with. And so knowing that they probably all would use and fiddle with AI, even if I told them not to,  I have explicitly asked them to and I'm having them  have the LLM summarize the article.

Uh, they have to do some prompt engineering, and they get marked on that, and then they also get marked on their evaluation of that summary.  Uh, a critique, a critical evaluation, uh, telling me what the AI did well, and what it did poorly.  Uh, and, so, I was very worried. It took me, like, a week to read the first ones, because I was like, was this assignment too easy, too hard, did it miss the mark? 

It worked. It did what I wanted it to. Uh, and They don't seem to hate it.  Thanks, Kris Krüg. I appreciate you sharing that. Um, Brittney Smaila. A lot of you guys know I pontificate about AI changing the future of education and that, you know, classrooms, deans, teachers, schools need to figure out this tech and instead of criminalizing our children by busting them with, you know, essay, you know, bots that can determine AI written essays, they need to figure out ways to work with students who live in this era of modern tools to re evaluate how education is delivered, how teaching is done, and That whole thing.

And so, this is one of the first people that I've seen in our community that's really kind of starting to mess with the model. And so, I appreciate you bringing back your reports from the street.  Andrew Reid is up next. Um, Andrew's an old homie. Um, you may know his father. His father runs a big, uh, research and data agency.

Um, but Andrew's here tonight. He approached me. Come on up, bro. Um, he approached me after a couple meetups ago and he's like, I like what you're doing. There's a lot of great energy and ideas coming. And he pitched me these last couple weeks on, um, running a, kind of a contest, data project, kind of almost like a little innovation lab kind of thing, and I'm going to let you talk more about it, but I'm excited about this because it's the, it's representative of the type of partnerships we want to do around here.

I'm going to talk a little bit about money later, about how much we bring in every month, about how your tickets cost, about the sponsors being involved and stuff, but at the end of the day, as we begin to invite corporations and businesses and stuff like that in, A lot of these models are gonna be with guys like Andrew, with Marius you're gonna meet tonight, with Dimitri and stuff like that, so I just wanted to give you a minute to like talk about a little who you are and that idea that you pitched and yeah  Thanks, KK.

I was like, KK loves the mic and the mic loves you. It's a good, it's a, it's a mutually beneficial relationship. Uh, so my name's Andrew Reid. I've been in the tech scene in Vancouver for a long time. I actually, uh, went to Vancouver Film School back in 1995 and took their multimedia program. These, uh, meetups,  Kind of remind me of, of, of way back then, when, you know, like, Macromedia bought FutureSplash, and the world was changing in a really exciting way.

Some, only some vintages remember this, and that that was exciting when that happened. Um, so I'm in the market research data collection space. I have a company called Rival that, uh, I started a few years ago. It's the second one. I've previously started a company called Vision Critical that was in town.

It's for a long time. And, um, the idea was just that,  Brands really care a lot about learning for their customers, but the experience of, like, running a survey and then building this big, boring PowerPoint presentation with the findings seems really out of touch, and I think there's an opportunity to drive some innovation around.

How do you tell stories with data? And so the idea is, meetup next month, hopefully, and I'm going to bring with me some data files. I'm going to have, Run a survey with probably about a thousand Canadians on a topic that KK and I can agree we think is interesting. I'm gonna ask ten questions. I'm gonna have some top line data for those that are kind of data nerds.

I'll have some cross tabs and some more sophisticated filtered data. I'll have some selfie videos. And it's just, how can we tell a story in two to five minutes using that? If you are anyone that is into visual design, sound. video, motion, really, it's very open ended. It can be anything at all. And so, I'm willing to throw out a prize of 3, 000 just to whoever we pick, and who KK, I think, maybe, or we decide pick that has a great idea.

We'll so this is a loose idea. KK was like, I don't get it. So I recorded him a one minute pitch, and he was like, okay, you can go on stage.  Uh, that's the loose idea. Come chat with me later if you want, but you will notice that between now and the next meetup we will have turned this into something that's got a little bit more framing around it, but really it's just how can we use AI to tell stories with data in an interesting way.

Thank you. Yeah.  He's super solid and he's the guy to be asking the questions, so I'm pretty excited about what we might come up with, and you can see how like  It's almost like a hack a thon. It's like a distributed AI community hack a thon with a 3, 000 prize or something like that. So, Andrew, thanks for being creative, bro.

He, we had a supporter level this month of 150. You got the patch, you got the shirt, you got the t shirt, and he brought several of those, and I appreciate it. Um, that actually gives me a little minute to talk about my homeboy Ender. Um, some of you guys here knew him. He's a guy that was a part of this community last year and passed away.

Uh, him and I worked on a lot of the art together, um, and tonight's Patch and Badge is the Black Square, and that was his brand, was Black Square Labs on, on Instagram. Um, he, uh, was building  spacesuits, space helmets, he had a textile production factory acro Hey, is Josh here, or Scott, or someone like that?

Yeah. You wanna say a thing or two?  I'm good. Okay. Um,  he's a homie, he's a, he was part of this,  Last New Year's Eve, we set the alarm off on my new studio, getting it set up for the very first meetup, uh, that we had a year ago, you know, and he was there with me the whole time, so, uh, yeah, we, we kind of commemorated him with the stickers and patches and stuff, um, they're for sale, but if you knew him and you want one, just tell Matty Jones you can have one and, and you can take one, um, thank you, Ender, and we'll have a memorial later, but I just wanted to, to bring his name up again, he's a, a special dude in our life, so, um, yeah, thanks for indulging me on that. 

Hey, Kevin is another maestro in this whole scenario. He helps me a lot with a lot of different things. And we got a bunch of different collaborations going on. But, um, he's been building technology for these events.  You've been, you've seen the generative backgrounds before at other events. I asked him not to talk about that tonight.

But, um, what I asked him to talk about is this other thing that he's building. So,  I could go on and on about everybody who's coming up on stage and I probably will. Um, but Kevin's in this really cool video pipeline AI course that he got recruited for with a bunch of other kind of like international badasses when it comes to creating tier one Hollywood video and audio effects.

He's doing some stuff for Netflix right now. He's got a lot of shit going on, but I wanted you to talk about the technology you built for tonight.  Thanks, Kris Krüg. Um, happy anniversary, by the way.  It's pretty amazing to acknowledge that, you know, we're only a year into this. And look at how everything has, you know, brought people together and all these opportunities have brought up.

And I'm so infinitely grateful for you and the team and the community. So, you know, first of all, thank you. That's amazing. Um, Kris Krüg said I can't talk about this, so just have a look. Um, yeah. This is a real time, generative, stable diffusion background that's being generated based on what we're saying up here, locally on his computer right over here.

Um, you'll see it morph between one concept and another. Yeah, real time animation that's going in, you know, this was a project that was really born out of,  You know, the vivid experimentation in this community that I've really embraced and brought a lot of things together. What I'm trying here tonight, and why I'm really clamoring to my phone here, is if you look in the back of the room, there's a, you know, very recent released Blackmagic PIXA 6K camera.

Yes, that's a 6K cinema camera. Um, what I'm building right now, I can, I can see it and control it through my phone. And what that also unlocks In the Blackmagic ecosphere is the capacity to stream while you're recording to your edit software in Blackmagic Resolve, um, DaVinci Resolve. And what that gets to unlock is Blackmagic has APIs that hook up to their app on the phone, hooks up to the camera in the Pixis, hooks up to DaVinci Resolve.

So what I'm testing out tonight. It's my edit box back home, running DaVinci Resolve, is literally streaming directly from this camera right now. And, talking to a version 1 LLM, that's transcoding everything, recognizing speakers, and eventually we'll be placing markers throughout, based on speakers, based on, you know, the, um, uh, the program that it knows of the show already.

And it's gonna be eventually, through talking through all the different APIs, Auto edit event clips while I'm shooting them, basically. 

It's one of those things where, you know, in 6K and, you know, you take one shot off of 6K, you get a medium shot at 4K, you get a tight at 1080p, and you're off to the races. And it has the capacity to do that. It's just getting the LLM to know the talk of all the different APIs that make it happen. And that's what I'm testing right now.

So Kevin and I have been doing all sorts of amazing stuff with the generative backgrounds, with the different camera systems these guys set up, and we can't keep up with the editing. There's more work and demand than there is time to edit, so now he's figuring out how to like, not wait for four weeks sitting on a stack of videos that need to see the world.

The whole wrapper with the  logos and stuff, and the text things can be applied on top, and that's all happening on his machine back home while we stream this to there.  That's it.  Automated event video content creation. So, take the, take the stress out of it, and just get all this amazing information and community out as fast as possible, so. 

How fast do you want? 

Once, once that pipeline is fully generated, the hope and dream is that I go home and put, like, the proper camera originals into it, hit render, and it's up within, like, you know, 20 minutes or half an hour after the event is done, so, yeah.  I jokingly call Kevin the only guy I can trust, and what I mean by that is when he's humming and hawing about it being 20 or 30 minutes, he can take that to the bank.

Yeah,  that's for real. Okay, thanks Kevin.  You're amazing.  Um,  Matthew Schwartzman.  This is going to be a kid who comes up here a couple times. I'm going to say a lot of nice things about him. But, um, first, I wanted to say, he's speaking on behalf of two people tonight. Um,  these guys came to me a little while ago.

Came to me and Kevin. They're like, yo, we really love what you're doing, but fucking Vancouver's a really far way to go. Could we start a Surrey AI community meetup?  Like a spinoff, sister, dealio, and we're like, yeah man. And they were like, and we're starting it next Tuesday. And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, come on. 

This ain't just something you just make. But they've been open to all the feedback, they've brought us all along on the journey with them. And so I'm happy to turn it over to Matthews and tell you a little bit about the, about the Start in March Surrey AI Community Meetup. So, it's kind of difficult to make it here when you're changing a clutch. 

And, you know, the job takes three days longer than it's supposed to take. And then you know you have an event coming up, and you know you gotta make it, but you're all the way out in Maple Ridge, or for the person who's not with me right now, he's all the way out in White Rock. So, we're like, okay, for people that are putting a clutch in their car,  How could we make them get to these AI events better?

So, we came up with a solution to have an AI event in Surrey. So, that's what we're doing. Um, we love this event. I mean, I've been here for quite some time now. Um, spoken in the past. Amazing event. Thank you, Kris Krüg. So, yeah, we wanna not replicate. We wanna do something very, very similar in partnership with Kris Krüg. 

So, these events are gonna happen. Second Tuesday of every single month, starting March, not February, but okay, okay, okay. So, we'll probably start March, um, that's I think the 11th, from 6 to 9 at the Legion No. 9 in, in Surrey. So, yeah, if, feel free to come up, talk to me about it, I'd love to share some more details, we're gonna have it up on Luma, Kris Krüg is gonna talk about it, and, yeah, excited to see a lot of you guys there.

Yeah, Matthew Schwartzman, Surrey AI Community Meetups.  Um, hang out with me here for a second though, you know. Um, so, Matthew runs a podcast called Teen To Life, uh, podcast, and that's how I got to know him. I heard from this guy called Dimitri Schwartzman, like, Almost a year ago now, it was like my son Matthew's gonna be getting in touch, he runs this podcast, um, he just wants to talk to you.

And I was like, great, I'll talk to him. It took a little while for you to get through my kind of force field of busyness or whatever, but I was so stoked when I did. I, um, really am excited about my relationship with Matthew. We got to know each other a lot over the last six months. I went on his podcast, Kevin went on his podcast, a whole bunch of people did.

He uses it as a strategic way to get access to  People that he finds inspiring, or heroic, or looks up to in some ways. He sat down with Chips Wilson, he sat down with a lot of people that are pretty fucking badass. And, how old are you? Uh, 18. 18, 18 years old.  He took my 6 week course, he really, uh, blew up minds when he was talking about how, um, he was, uh, using AI to write his essays, but then he had gotten really good at cursive because he had to handwrite them with a pencil so that the teacher didn't realize that he was writing them with AI.

Because they were coming in handwritten in cursive. So we, we, we formed a really good friendship and collaboration. He started volunteering here, he brought Itamar around, who's like one of my main mans around here when it comes to volunteers. He's a super helpful, smart guy and stuff. And so, um, I recently asked Matthew if he'd become like our sponsorships and partnerships manager, because we're starting to bring on some sponsors.

I'm winging it here tonight, and so I'm going to do community announcements and sponsors right now in the middle, and then we're going to go back to community announcements. So, um, Matthew's like learning, I'm learning from him, he's learning from me, but he's, as you, you can probably realize a lot of the, he's articulate, and he's smart, and he's charming and stuff, and so I really think that he's done a great job of representing these events, and I thought that, you know, we could hang out and work together more if, uh, if he, if he volunteered in this role and give him a little stipend or whatever and stuff, so, um, thanks for coming around, bro.

Uh, I want to introduce a couple sponsors tonight, and I want him to introduce one of them, but, um, okay, here's the deal, guys. We bring in about 5, 000 here. And the event costs about 5, 000. The venue is 1, 000. The food is 1, 000. The drinks are 1, 000. We give tips and honorariums to various performers and speakers and staff members and licenses and fees and insurance and stuff like that.

I'm going to give you 1, 000. Not 

to you.  Um, that's Wanda.  She blew my mind long before she just said that, but, um.  So anyway, that's our deal, more or less. So, we pay a 50 or 60 ticket, but it covers the drinks, the food, the performers, and, like, I don't make any money, Brittany makes a couple hundred bucks, Kevin makes a couple hundred bucks, you know, like, we pass out very small stipends or whatever, but we brought on two sponsors this month.

Um, the Space Center, I first want to say thank you, because by forming a 15 month partnership with me, they've allowed me to sell real sponsorships. I don't want to go chase my tail selling a 300 or 500 sponsorship on a one off basis once a month to different people. And in order to not do that, you have to have a contract on the place that you're dwelling in.

And so Lorraine Lowe and the Space Center have partnered with us to give us the runway that we need to bring on some key partners.  So the first one I want to introduce is Marius. And Marius, you can come on up.  Marius and Damika from Segev Law Firm. Come on up. So, guys, um, this ain't gonna happen necessarily every month, but I want you to know what's going on here.

I want you to know about the money in the spirit of, like, authenticity and transparency. So, Marius works at a firm called Segev. Segev's got about 45 lawyers. You can correct me on the little details I get wrong. Um, but I know Ron Segev. And Ron Segev, uh, his band played my 30th birthday party on the rooftop of 1 Alexander in, in, in Gastown.

Um, he's a bro and an old homie. I started an online magazine in 1998 that Ron Segev wrote for. Um, and, uh, Ron and his brother Elon went on to form Segev LLP. They've got a whole bunch of lawyers working for them now. They work in the kind of crypto, online gaming, web 3, AI type space or whatever. So, I'm going to give a minute to say something.

I doubt it'll be much of a sales pitch. All I want to say is, we've got like a legit legal practice backing our work now. They can help you with IP, they can help you with incorporation, questions about that, because they've been involved with interesting cases along the way. There was an AI loot box thing that I read about on their blog and stuff.

Anyway, Marius, welcome to this stage, community, just say whatever you want, bro. Thanks  very much. My name is Marius Adomnik. I'm a partner at Segev LLP. I work with Ron who, him and Kris Krüg go way, way back. I'm going to actually have more questions for Kris Krüg about Ron back in the day after this.  Um, so yeah, we're a full service law firm based here in Vancouver.

Um, we do, we can do anything from incorporating you to taking it public. Um, but we do a lot of stuff as Kris Krüg said, but anything techie, cutting edge, like we do a lot of crypto stuff. We work with a lot of AI companies. A lot of startups. Um,  So yeah, we're excited to have this partnership going. Uh, we're going to be around for a year.

Me and another one of our lawyers, our lawyer is Nagin, are here tonight. Um, we're going to be around, excited to be supporting this event with Kris Krüg. So,  Any questions about the legal stuff, come talk to me after. Thanks very much.  Um, thanks Marius. I really appreciate it, man. Uh, he also speaks on lots of panels.

I see him, saw him talk at the AI Summit down at BCIT,  talking about legal AI frameworks and stuff like that. Also, he only has a contract for six months, but I haven't pitched him for a year, and he just announced a year from the stage, so I'm going to consider him that double inde Good job. Thanks for doubling down, buddy.

Um, actually, to be even more transparent, I pitched him on a high number, and he said how about this low number, we'll do it for a while though, like you want, so you can have it month over month. If we see some people talking to us, we see some companies happening, if we have some good conversations, we'd love to be involved with this more deeply at the higher number or whatever.

So, anyway, that's, that's the nature of our relationship, and welcome.  Um,  is James Lester here?  James Lester runs Sons of Vancouver. Um, they're a distillery on the North Shore. They've given us like 10 bottles of vodka for our cocktails for a year now. And they, they send really interesting people to be a part of this community.

I give them free tickets every month in exchange for those bottles of vodka. And they, um, they send very interesting people to our meetups and workshops. So thanks Alvy for being a part of this community and stuff like that. Um, Meta Creation Lab, SFU, Philippe Pasquier.  Um, Mariana, who you're gonna meet tonight, speaking, introduced me to Philippe last February.

Philippe's become my number one supporter in this whole thing. I just really can't thank him enough. This month, he gave us two 55 inch LG screens for our out there demo stations. Last, uh, three months ago, he gave us a 10, 000 sound system. Um,  thanks, Philippe, for believing in this and supporting it, man. Um, we're, we're, he supports Lionel, who's a, now, a research.

person in his lab. We're doing Canada Arts Council grants together. He's just, I'm looking for people that want to put the best of what they got into the mix and see what we can make out of it, and Philippe's that kind of guy. So thank you very much, Philippe. Appreciate you being a part of it. Don't worry, Matthew.

I told you you were going to be shadowing me. You didn't know that it meant like hanging out on stage while I talked for an hour. I could be in your shot. No, bro. No way, bro. Um, so, also, don't go nowhere.  Don't go nowhere.  Corey, Corey's not here. Corey runs a distributor company called Goodness. They've started giving us, um, pallets of water, pallets of mocktails, stuff like that.

He's a connection through Lorraine Lowe. Lorraine, from the Space Center here, has been bringing all the best things she has and introducing us to her people, and so Corey's a recent sponsor. I wanted to thank him as well.  Sons of Vancouver, Meta Creation, Goodness, Segiv. That's the only one left.  Um So, I wanted to give Matthew a minute to introduce our next sponsor, we have another month a munch cast sponsor that, um, I'm just gonna let Matthew do it. 

Awesome, okay. So, this sponsor, very important sponsor. My first sponsor that I helped bring on, very difficult to get, very busy all the time. I have, I'm, I have close connections with him though. Um,  one of the reasons being,  Maybe because he's my dad? 

But yeah, so, my father, Dimitri Schwartzman. Um, I 

think resemblance is kind of there.  Um, but yeah, real estate agent, best real estate agent. I'm a bit biased, maybe, maybe not, I don't know, up to you. Um, but yeah, so, my, my sponsor. 

Thank you, Kris Krüg. Thank you, Matthew. It's pretty exciting to see this because about half a year ago we started with this and we've learned what Kris Krüg does.  I thought it was amazing. I've been in the graphics world for a number of years, moved into real estate and I've been doing this for over a decade now.

And it's, it's incredible to see, um, the people communicating with each other and coming up with new ideas.  I've been involved with some of you with some ideas. I'm trying to find a way to push real estate industry a little bit closer to AI. Because a lot of people in this business are afraid to try something different, something new.

And it doesn't scare me and I'm hoping to educate as much as I can. And if you have ideas, suggestions, how real estate can benefit from different tools, I'll be happy to, to listen to it and take it further to maybe we can implement it in the future with real estate.  Thanks very much.  You got anything you want to add? 

You have anything you want to add? Um, talk to me about sponsorships, partnerships, anything. Talk to me about it.  Um,  you know, some people think I'm anti corporation, anti money, and it's not that. It's that when money comes into an event like this, they do it on their own terms oftentimes, and they can often suck all the air out of the room.

Money has a strong gravitational pull. It makes stuff happen. It represents potential energy, right? So So, when building this, I've been very strategic about centering non profits,  academia, artists, creatives, knowing that money's gonna come later, but not wanting it to become our personality or deviate us from our course.

So, welcome to the money in the room. This is the environment you're finding yourself in, and we really, really appreciate your support. We couldn't do it without you. Um, seriously. I can't pay everyone 250 a month forever, right? So I appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. Okay, speaking of those everybody's, actually now is a good time to be like, Itamar, Kevin, if you've had anything to do with organizing or planning this event, if you're a volunteer or anybody involved, come on up for a quick sec. 

If you can, Kevin. Brittany, that's you. Come on, guys. You know who you are. Jeff Clark has been here. Roz.  Lawrence, of course. Guys, don't make me call you all by name. I can't see everybody. Kush, if you want to come, you're a part of this whole thing too.  I just wanted to say thanks to everybody who makes this happen, you know, like it's a whole team,  um,  because we're all doing it kind of like off the side of our desk and the goodness of our heart.

We're just,  no one's making no money. We're just into this cause we believe in it. And then low key guys like Loki are out there advocating for all of us trying to big tens of millions of dollars in from provincials and federal governments, the types of things we're doing. Um, I just appreciate you guys, step in the light, let the picture get taken, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I appreciate you guys, yeah, I really do, yeah, I really do.  Yeah, talk to these folks with your ideas, whatever you guys want to do around here, these are the people that represent, you know, the eyes and ears of this whole community, so, so thank you very much. Thank you, guys.  Alright, alright.  We're so close to the, the end of all this part. 

Key on.  I almost forgot.  Um, Kian goes to, um, SFU, come on up, uh, School of Interactive Art and Technology, Meta Creation Lab. Philippe, are you around?  Come on, too. Yeah, you're gonna talk, but I just want him to be here. He can say whatever he wants at the end. Kian's, uh, one of Philippe's students. He's running the demo out here.

Also, these two guys are in a artist collective that two months from now is gonna be dropping a pretty interesting, immersive performance and experience on us. So, I just wanna invite you to say whichever you want about your work or Just whatever you want, bro.  Thanks.  Uh, yeah, my name is Kion and, uh, yeah, first of all, thanks for inviting me here, Kris Krüg and, uh, also always, uh, Philippe, my professor who is always supporting me.

And, uh, yeah, I'm mostly working on machine improvisation system. I was a demo guy outside and, uh, today I was, um, demoing the computer assisted composition system. And, uh, yeah, so we have artist collective or band, uh, named Keffia. Like, K for Keone and, uh, P is like for Philippe. And, uh, there's another guy called, uh, Vijay, Vijay Amegi.

So it's like  Keffia. And, uh, yeah, we've been working on that. And, yeah, I think it's gonna be April, right?  April, yeah. We are gonna perform on April here. And, yeah, thanks for inviting me. Like this week or whatever. And it blew my mind. The audio was amazing. The visuals that were generated, they were amazing.

I'll try to send it around and put it on the channel or whatever. But like, they're up to some really cool shit. Yeah, we played it once in China at Music Acoustica last year, and that would be a  Canada, North America first, actually.  Yeah, I don't know. We'll see if we can fill the room. How many people do you play for in China?

Oh, 600. 600 is a big The largest conservatory in the world is in Hangzhou. There's 5, 000 students learning music at the same time. It's, uh, it's what China does. You look like an AI generated portal. This photo of him on stage, I was like, this looks like a sci fi. Yeah, yeah, we won't have the same screen that they have.

That's, that's, yeah. But we'll bring, so the lab is gonna sponsor the community by bringing extra speakers in this room, so we'll have a, a reinforcement system for that. Yeah. Thanks, Kris Krüg. Thanks, Lee. Okay, just to orient the speakers who  are probably on pins and needles, Lionel's up first, and then Nicole. 

Um, give me just one quick sec to make sure I didn't miss anybody in this important, or Rain, I did almost miss somebody. Are you, are you here still too? Hi!  Um, this is actually a perfect time for you to come up because, you know, now, like, the chaos of the last hour's done. Gonna get into the focus of what these guys have to share with us and stuff, and so.

Orain works at Hollyhock. Um, she's Lionel's partner. I've gotten to know her through this community. And, um, yeah, I'm really ha I asked you to talk a few months ago about some of the trippier stuff that we're into, but, um, I know that you're here tonight to make some community announcements, and I I'm really happy you're here.

Woo! 

My truest expression, or one of them, is behind the scenes on a spreadsheet. So, if anyone's like me that's really nervous to be on stage, you're witnessing.  some comfort zone extension. Um, Kris Krüg mentioned, I work at Hollyhock, so just a little taste of the Hollyhock experience with you, if you all want to indulge me for a moment. 

If you're like me, you've kind of like been in your head all day, we've been listening, you know, and so I would love to invite a moment to just get back into our bodies.  And so if you'd like, play with me, feel free to close your eyes, or if you feel more comfortable to gaze down,  and just take a deep breath. 

Slow inhale,  through the mouth, exhale it out. If  that felt good, let's do one more. 

Thank you.  So, well, that's not it.  Um, so, my name is Orane, and I work at Hollyhock, which is a leadership retreat center up on Cortez. I know there's a bunch of hollyhockers here today in the crowd, so I'm very happy to see some representation. Um, so our purpose is to renew people's connection to themselves, each other, and the natural world.

And so we do that through immersive experiences, and so that often looks like retreats, where you say good morn morning to each other, good night to each other, eat me eat three meals, go to the sauna, swim in the ocean. It's quite a magical experience. And I'm excited to share that this October, we're running our inaugural AI and Consciousness Gathering.

It's the first of a three year gathering, and um,  The reason why we see that this is important for us to gather now is because we really want to be able to serve the collective  humanity and our collective growth, and not just perpetuate this  efficiency oriented, profit driven world that we see. And so, how are we gonna do that?

And, um, so we're bringing together 60 curated, invitation only artists, technologists, policy makers, activists. You know, we really wanna see that diverse perspective,  um, of the world that we see today. And so, my ask is that we're actually in the planning phases and we're looking for advisors. Specifically, I would love to have  An advisor that also represents the diversity that we wish to see, this equitable future that we wish to see in the world.

And so I would love if we had some representation from the global majority because this advisor plays an important role, not just in shaping the content of the gathering, but they also shape the culture, and they help us allocate our sponsor scholarships, um, which is a key part in making sure that we also have the representation we need to see in the room.

So, if that is you, or if that is someone that you know, I would love to talk to you. And also, if you're interested in contributing to our scholarship fund, we do fundraise specifically for that. So, I would also love to have a conversation with you as well.  With that,  thank you, and come back. 

It would be my pleasure to introduce  the first speaker, Lionel Ringenbach,  um, or as we call colloquially in our home, Darling, or Mao.  Um, and so, uh, I've witnessed Lionel for the past  five years of our relationship, kind of really go through some  You know, like, existential moments. And so it's been really beautiful for the past few years, really seeing himself emerge as this creative technologist, as this artist, as this truest expression of Eukodya that I've seen.

And so it's really beautiful to see how you've grown, and this confidence, and this growth. And so, uh, last year if you were here in December, he gave a talk and he was sweating. And so nervous up until it. And so now, he volunteered himself to talk, which is really exciting. I'm really sending him up well to share this talk that we've been shopping in the house for the past few weeks.

Um, so, I've heard it a bunch of times, but I'm excited for you to all hear it for the first time. Leonel. 

Hello everyone. Um, thank you, thank you.  Thank you, Kris Krüg, for inviting me again here.  And, um, so tonight I would like to talk about, this talk is, What's up with AI? And that's not a typo. It's really about talking about energy consumption about AI.  So the, the, how it started for me to get investigated to this is that, Not so long ago, over New Year's Eve, I went away for 10 days without any technology with me.

And I decided that, oh, that's a perfect time for starting training a AI model at home while I'm away. For 10 days. And as I started to drive away, existential dread came and I'm like, I actually don't know what I'm doing. How am I gonna have, like, this crazy Bill, or maybe is the house gonna burn down? So I had no idea, really.

I only heard anecdotes from people saying that AI does this, AI does that, it's very bad, it's very good.  Oh, it's disconnected. 

Yes, if you can, I can ask you next, that would be perfect. Let's go next.  So that was me, I was like, this is fine, this is okay, right? We're gonna make it through. So I realized it was a really blurry picture and I hear a lot of anecdotes around going and doesn't seem there's a lot of grounding hallways. So I was really curious to investigate what he makes AI power consumption and what it really is.

Maybe or maybe not. I don't, you know, so can we go to the next please?  So I'm going to give a little bit of introduction about how what makes AI AI in terms of like Power usage. So the power tools are graphics card, also called GPUs, and they are the main consumer of energy in AI workloads. Some of the popular data center models that we have today is like two NVIDIA models that are both consuming 700 watts and 1, 000 watts, the new model that they released early this year.

There's a lot of power, but  it all depends on how much you use it. So tensor processing units are becoming more and more popular. It's not very clear how much you're going to use. Maybe the more efficient, less. And all traditional computing units are still useful for running AI, but are kind of negligible in terms of power usage. 

Can we go to the next please?  Um, so the type of usage of AI also to kind of clarify, there is three main types. The first is training, and this one can take  or maybe weeks, months, maybe a lot more. It really depends. And these ones are very power hungry because they require clusters of GPUs. Um, for example, uh, GPT 3 was trained on 10, on a cluster of 10, 000 GPUs, one of those 700 watt GPUs.

So it's, uh, could be a lot of energy and they yield what we call the so called AI models. That's what the training does.  Then this is tuning. Tuning is a way of, like, improving a model without, so it's more like short, medium term running tasks. They can go for hours or days, maybe weeks if you want. But it's a way of kind of improving on your previously built model without having to start from scratch.

And finally is generation. This is the one that you are more, uh, using every day in general. It's like ChatGPT when you ask for a response through text. It's called also inferences. This is like a more the final short term running task this can take seconds minutes But now I can see that hours and days can happen in the tech kind of like video world now where we generate It can take a very long time  Can we go to next please? 

And so I started investigating what do the numbers say about like these companies running those big giant players of Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta Google, Amazon, XAI And they don't disclose anything. They like to sometimes boast how many GPUs they have in their clusters, like XAI Likes to tell that they have 100, 000 and they're gonna expand to 200, 000 this year They don't really know about how much is actually being used in terms of energy or what is the source of the energies that they use  And no number of GPU count is actually Disclosed as well.

It's very hard to tell. What I could tell from my estimation is maybe that those Giant players are about 1 to 3 million GPUs, you know And those are like the 700 watts minimum. This is not the one that you have in your computer at home in general 

So I thought let's play let's play a game number games of our own I just tried to think about how could I figure out What the JGPT power usage could be, just theoretically. I can't prove that this is real, this is like, really like a napkin science we're doing here.  So Sam Altman was very happy in December to share that they have reached 

Thank you, Kris Krüg. Thank you. Um, so some of mine disclosed in December, not the numbers, the deeper number, but the high level numbers, which are like 300 million users of chat GPT nowadays, and 1 billion requests a day. So I was like, Oh, maybe from that number, I can get to some idea of how much chat GPT cost every day. 

So I tried to run on my machine, like calls to chat GPT over and over for a lot of times with It's small requests, medium requests, large requests, to kind of have an idea of how long does it take to do those requests. And came to the idea of like an optimistic, which would be like a small request, like the best case scenario request took about 2.

8 seconds, which I reduced to 2. 2 as a runtime for GPU, kind of like a 80%.  And. The optimistic is that it actually uses four GPUs to run that model. It's optimistic, it could be eight, in the pessimistic view. And the GPU power would be 600, so the lowest class of GPUs, not the best of the class. And I came that a single request usually would be 1.

46 watts.  And in the worst case scenario, 4. 4. I read on the internet that people evaluated would be 3. 9. So I thought that was probably in the right area.  And this means that for running 3GPT for one day, it's equivalent to one year of energy usage of 140 to 1, 560 U. S. households. The yearly usage for a single day of running it. 

I thought that's quite a lot. Can you go next?  Whoops.  Can we go next?  So I thought about this analogy. It's probably not right, but Why not, you know? Think about every time you run SharedGPT,  Think like from the moment it starts replying to the time it hands, not when it starts replying. It's like this world is the computing.

It's actually streaming the response. So it's continuously computing as it gives you the answer.  It's like running four to eight microwave, average microwave, the whole time it is doing.  Just think about this, you know, like that's the latest NVIDIA microwave here. 

So it's all really even blurry to me still, um, after doing the investigation. It wasn't more clear. I realized that a lot of the numbers are not being disclosed, so it's very hard to tell. But I did find some numbers online, and I heard anecdotes being, going around, and I found back those anecdotes, or like, more like numbers, online and tried to verify where those source came from. 

So one of them was that data centers and data centers is for like all computing like cloud computing Not just ai ai is kind of like a still a sliver of data center computing Is about one to 1. 5 total electricity use which is estimated to be about one person of overall co2 emissions Only for data center.

So it means like ai would be a small smaller portion of that  The numbers came from the international energy agency And I heard those numbers over and over. When I looked into their website, they seemed very official, but I couldn't find the source of the data.  So I'm still, I don't know, like,  maybe, maybe it's true.

I don't know. I found other estimates that said that 2. 1 to 3. 9 percent of overall CO2 emission is just AI. So there's a lot, lot more. That's like a seriously large gap between maybe people who are more optimistic and more pessimistic. But what I realized is that If those big companies don't disclose the numbers, how could we actually know those numbers?

It seems very hard.  So it's still a very blurry picture at this moment. 

I did ask to GPT and it can give you different answers at different times. 

It does give you different answers at different time. Differently, I will give you different answers. So it was not clear what was going on there. Actually it had perplexity, deny, What I was saying about, like, Salman Man saying it's one billion requests, but no, it's impossible with PublicityZombie. It's like, that's actually happened.

I can't find it in the news. No, it's there. It's like he actually said it. Anyway, maybe also he's boosting numbers that are not real. We don't know, but  that's what was said.  So, but I realize that right now we're kind of flying blind. We don't really know.  The big, uh, companies that are doing cloud computing don't really monitor those numbers.

Um, I worked in a big cloud providers for many, many years, and I can tell that the CO2 emission was on the pictures, but it was not something very precise, more like a ballpark estimation that we were reporting.  So what can we do about this? Is there something we can do about not flying blind?  So if you're a builder and you are curious, um, you know, like into, can I tell what is actually happening in my systems?

How much power is it using? Is it what kind of CO2 might be emitted based on where I'm running this computing? There are tools and they are free. Um, you can integrate with CodeCarbon, for example, which is a tool that's made exactly for that. I will present it after that. Hugging Phase, for example, the training tools from Hugging Phase integrate directly with CodeCarbon so that when you train your AI, you will know exactly how much power was used by your machine and also based on the location of where you did the training, you will know how much CO2 it might be or the energy mix that was going into the training. 

Cloud presenters don't seem to monitor this in a meaningful way from what I said and what I've seen. It's like kind of a ballpark estimation, but not really precise, when actually the hardware manufacturer provides you a very clear number, like whether it's Intel, NVIDIA, or Apple, you can know exactly, to the milliwatt hour, how much is your CPU using or your GPU using. 

So, what you can do is locate also accordingly, based on the energy mix of your local area or where the GPUs are located.  BC is not known to have lots of, like, GPUs, but we have a good energy mix at the moment, so.  And it applies to all types of computing. I realized going through CodeCarbon and implementing it in my local workflows that actually I could tell even any kind of computing usage of energy.

I worked in big IT company before, cloud computing, and were very serious about capturing metrics about absolutely everything. But this is not something we ever captured. So I'm a bit surprised that we don't do it because it's actually free to do and we could know it today. We don't have to fly in blind. 

So this is CodeCarbon. And I put the QR code here if you're curious to see or go to codecarbon. io It's free, open source. It has no overhead for you to run it. Um, even on your laptop you can run it. I've done it on my Macbook and I can tell now exactly what it does.  And it supports all type of computing monitoring to um quite accurate measurement, especially if you have an NVIDIA graphics card. 

So that's like, for example, when I was training a StyleGAN model and it could tell how much the training took and how much generation of email of  images was taking. 

And there is currently an art residency that Mutek is doing. Mutek is one of the biggest, um, Electronic Arts Festival in North America, which is happening in Montreal in August. And they have currently a call for artists, or for soft engineers, if you are also more going on that creative side, to actually have projects on how to freeze the AI Ecology Lab.

If you have any ideas, then I really encourage you to apply. I put the QR code here. You can go to the Mutech forum website as well. And please reach out to me if you're interested to work on something. I have an idea, I will be applying for this, so,  please, reach out.  Go on. 

Because again, we got a non gatekeeper here. This is a grant that's still open, that you can go apply for, and beat him out for, or whatever. Like, the whole model these days is that, like, people are, like, holding on to information about where the money's coming from, where the access is coming from, until it's almost too late for you to apply.

They'll tell you about it like the day before.  So I just really appreciate you being like, I want collaborators. This thing's open. Here's the QR code or make your own project. They're looking for two people outside the West areas, the East area. So  anybody in Canada and the West, especially you're welcome to apply. 

You're amazing, dude. Um, I got introduced to him very early last year. He's come on. He built the compo vision thing, which you didn't get a chance to see today, but it's pretty incredible. It's not really working today. Maybe after that it will work. We had a power issue.  Bro, that's what happens when you try to get fancy like it blew people's mind eight months ago And then now you're trying to add features and stuff, but like it's it's pretty amazing.

It's it's um You put stuff in front of his AI robot eyes, and it makes prompts out of it, based on what it sees. But then it prompts new images based on what you're showing it, based on LLM, like, turns it into text, sends it up to the model, shows you back images based on whatever you put in front of the thing, you know.

It's pretty amazing.  Okay.  Um, I'm actually not done with you yet, though. Just hang out for one more minute while I smother you with love. Um, so, he's heading home to France soon. And he's been a big part of this community, and so he asked an I. E. O., can I do all this stuff? He, um, helped build the, he built the stage thingy that, uh, Holy Mother of the Void danced in front of earlier.

Brought those, you know, got us to get those special light bulbs. He almost set up CompoVision. He did this research here that's like, you guys, so many people talk like they know about how much energy and water and what's going on. And like, this guy's like looking into it, giving you facts, first order research.

You can take it to the bank, you know. So I appreciate you, bud. We're gonna miss you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Orain, for a much better introduction than I could have ever done, so. Um, we got three speakers left. I think it'll take about 35 minutes. If you need to pop out and grab a drink, come back. You're welcome to.

Just, you know.  Be respectful. Um, Nicole, are you still here? Great. Um, I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Nicole. Nicole came up from Seattle today to give this talk tonight. She's an AI adoption specialist. She's working with like BC Government and Kelowna this week. Did a workshop for 80 people.

You know, this is kind of the thing I'm interested in too. Education, adoption, training around AI. Um, I've been inspired by what you're up to. She's traveling the world all the time. She's got a very unique message and um, Um,  we've got a bonafide perspective here now and like a community and now I'm ready to like take our community and rub it against other communities like the Seattle community and the, and the Calgary community and stuff like that and like let's see what's going on.

Let's form some partnerships and some alliances. So, welcome from Seattle, Nicole Donnelly. Okay. 

Well, thank you. Thanks for having me. I'll show  you a little something. This happened five days ago. 

Maybe we'll get it.  Here we go.  Does anybody snowboard still in the room?  Alright, ski?  And would you like to be enjoying freshies, like every day that they're available, like this weekend and the next few days when we're supposed to be getting snow? So, in 2006  7, I kept asking myself, like, how can I snowboard more?

How can I make work easy and fun like snowboarding? I used to do big air at the X Games, used to race border cross, and spent some of my early 20s as a professional snowboarder.  Before that, I finished school by the time I was 20, and I studied history, German, and photography. Um, in Utah. And I took snowboarding as a class. 

And so when I finished school and people asked what I wanted to do, and I, I said that, that's what I want to do.  I want to snowboard.  And then fast forward, uh, a few years, I make it to X Games, which was my goal every day. I would ride and I would practice so that I could go do this.  And  I still ask myself that it's been more than 20 years  and I still have been asking myself that question.

So in 2015, when I was introduced to my first AI tool, I was like, oh, this is fantastic. It's gonna shortcut what we're doing.  And I started doing AI workshops in 2015,  and I had to buy lunch for everybody at the WeWork so that they would come to a lunch and learn and see this AI stuff.  And in the last two years, I've been to more than a dozen countries, virtually more than 30 countries, delivering AI workshops,  and doing training, and we've trained more than 10, 000 people. 

So that you can snowboard more, work less, get more of your brain back, and more creativity. Because the stats show that 80 percent of the time, we're doing work that we don't really want to do, that's busy work.  Right? You sit in front of the computer. For me, the worst is spreadsheets. Sora Rain, when you said that, I was like, Oh,  I hate doing spreadsheets.

And I opened up the tab to chat GPT. I'm like, I wonder if I can do this in here. And this was two years ago. I was like, hey, this three hour project took 20 minutes.  Right? And so Friday, I'm gonna go, uh, tubing with my friends, uh, up at Cypress. Um. Because, you know, my enjoyment of snow is a little more mellow now. 

And we figured out a way where our team now doesn't have to work on Fridays.  We can all take Fridays off.  Yeah.  And that's what I want everybody to be able to do and to think about all the time. So my big mission in life is bringing joy to a billion people. I've done it in different ways. I used to teach skiing and snowboarding.

I'd like to think I brought joy to people teaching them how to ride. And I also had a company where we sold leg warmers for babies all over the world. I sold millions of them, and I'd like to think I brought joy to people selling baby legs.  Yeah, you know baby legs.  Now they're in the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle. 

Right next to the Nintendo.  Which, leg warmers for babies. You'll see them there still. Um, and there's just so many ways to bring joy. And I love how everybody in here is so creative. And this is the most creative, so I think bringing some of this energy down to Seattle would be a really good idea.  The Allen Institute is sponsoring an AI house, which we don't know when it's going to open. It was announced at the end of the year. But there are physical locations available for AI meetups.

And I would like to invite and host everybody down in Seattle too, because it's so good to exchange, and I always bring people down and bring people up here because the way that everybody thinks across the border is totally different. And I do work with economic development here in BC. We're working on training economic developers how to use AI better.

Because the average  Job span is two years for an economic developer.  Because they have too much work and they get burnt out.  And imagine somebody who has this workload where you get burnt out so much,  then being able to take Fridays off.  I think you'll have a lot greater retention. And you can still pay people the same amount and work four days a week. 

Imagine that.  Who wouldn't like that?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  And that's why I say to my team, we have people all over the world that work for us. Everybody's contractors. And when, we've got people in the Philippines too, and when we said, you know, we're two weeks off at Christmas, one of the girls almost started crying. 

And I said, oh no, you'll get paid, don't worry. And she started crying even more.  Because she didn't think she'd be able to take two weeks off and get paid.  And she's going to law school, we give her the paid week off to take exams, and when she's studying, we give her that time.  And I just like to approach it with that generosity, and that, that when we can do more for other people, like, they'll be happier and stick with us for a while.

Um, we just did a big project in Silicon Valley, for a really big name AI company. We developed their certification program. They were going to give us two enterprise clients to train under their name in Q4. They gave us 15. We trained 2, 000 people how to use AI. Then they promptly fired us  and tried to recruit my trainers. 

For Silicon Valley wages.  And my trainers didn't go. 

Yeah.  I don't pay them as much as those guys would. But they also wouldn't be able to have the flexibility in the life.  And I want that to be flipped, your 80 20 to be flipped, where 80 percent of the time you get to work on the things that you love, and work in your magic. 20 percent of the time is the BS that we all have to do. 

Um, and I think we're closer to that. Like we're so much closer to spending 80 percent of our time in our magic. And whenever we're doing things for clients, every single time we bring on a new client, we think, how can we deliver more magic to this client? And how can we make it easier, shorten the process, automate it, use AI, leverage the shit out of this moment that we have in technology to make our lives better? 

And so, I want everybody to know how to use it well. Like, that's, I'm so passionate about it, and we give seats to students because  We know that they need to. I have a 20 year old.  And my 20 year old uses it as a study buddy. At a university that had a really hard nursing school program, the people who, the nurses, the students who got to use AI,  dropped out 80 percent less. 

Because they had that AI study buddy, it's really, really effective in teaching to various learning styles.  And so from kids, all the way to, I have a friend who's 75 years old, and she doesn't want to be one of those old people who's afraid of technology, and so I'll sit with her and show her how to do the things that she wants to do, um, using AI. 

It might be keeping track of all the food allergies in the family, and then just asking for recipes at Christmas that match everybody's allergies.  Right? Like, there's such simple uses. But, uh, that's That is what I'm here for. I'm here to bring joy. And, um, if I can host everybody in Seattle, that'd be super fun. 

So, thanks for having me here.  Hang out with me for just a second in case you have something to add to what I'm about to say. Um, so Loki was up here first and Loki was talking about, he's like been talking to the federal government. He's trying to, he's building a BCAI center. Well, a lot of that is gonna be focused around education and adoption.

Like, our B. C. economy is built quite heavily on the creative industries, on special effects, games, animation, this whole thing. We have 11 of the top 12 video games headquarters here in B. C. And that is, yeah, it didn't happen by accident. We don't have the same organic growth as like Silicon Valley. It came through investments in the sector.

I see Jai Jua here, friends like old Linda Brown, who helped build the Center for Digital Media on Great Northern Way, and that whole place. Like, the reason we have the economy that we have, where you look around, like, say, Olympic Village, and everybody there has a job that didn't exist 20 years ago, is because of, like, investments in the sector, and a decision to create this.

And places like VFS, and all the schools, they feed the studios, and then places like Um, DigiBC and LockDow, who's like a defender of the tax credit for these studios. He helps to make that suite for those companies so they stay here, the schools can feed them. And that feeds the speculative real estate market that we all live in, you know, or whatever. 

But that's the BC economy or whatever, right? And it's about to, um, face some serious challenges. Turns out, generating special effects, and explosions, and fucking laser beams is a lot easier than it used to be. Um, these junior designers and developers, there's a risk, they're at threat, you know, and so,  people like Loki, people like Brenda Bailey, people like me, a lot of other people in this room, you know, we're trying to put BC on a map with AI, we're trying to put all our eggs in one basket and build something significant, so, part of the reason why you're here, I'm learning about all this, I'm learning about how do you upskill, Industries at a time, uh, groups of people at a time, and like, um, Is it about teaching them tools?

Is it about teaching them how to think about it? Like, what, what is, so I'm, I'm learning, I'm researching.  I appreciate you coming up, bringing your perspective, bringing your American self up here, you know, and uh, Stars and Stripes, and like.  Yeah, I love it. I've always said we're a big tent, right? We're, this is like, researchers, it's business people, it's venture capitalists, it's Americans, it's Canadians.

It's like, I'm American actually, but uh, thank you so much. Um, I really appreciate you being here. And um,  Right before she went on stage, I was like, Nicole, are you into what we're doing here? Like, is this cool? And she's like, I want to talk to you about being a  Thank. Yeah, that's true. Thank you. Thank you so much.

You're welcome. Yeah. 

Um, like, I'm kind of excited about this transition right here now too. Maria Mariana is up next, and Mariana, um, works at Northeastern. She's a professor, she's a researcher, and it's a lot different tale that she has to tell you than what Nicole's talking about. Um, this is academic research, front lines of thinking about how we interact with the guys.

Come on up, please. And, um. You know, one of the things I put on the, um, the marketing of this, like, what does it mean to be human in the age of machines? Like, this is, like, what I think about a lot. This is why we present, um, Holy Mother of the Void, uh, in her embodiment dancing and stuff like that. Thank you, Marina, for being here for, for a year and bringing, you know, like, what does it mean to be human in this age, you know?

Like, what, what's unique about us and stuff? And so, at the other end of that, we have Amirana,  who, um,  she introduced me to Felipe. Who I've already said how much he means to me and I have that to thank you for, um, but you've also introduced me to this idea of synthetic personas. And so we hear about synthetic data a lot, uh, particularly in the, when they talk about like hitting the edge of scaling laws and, um, we're, we, we sucked up all the data on the internet, but don't worry about it.

They're going to make more synthetic data and they'll train the future AI models on that. And I start to think about synthetic data, and then you start to think about, like, synthetic audiences. I'm into this idea of synthetic audiences right now. Like, um, I'm about to  start coaching a Google lab for journalists, and a lot of them are interested in synthetic audiences right now.

The idea that I could make a million people that are like the people that I want to target, or that already read my thing, um, and I could run.  whole business plans or future models on my synthetic audience and, and then that gets me back to the work that originally captivated me with you, was around synthetic, synthetic personas and stuff like that and synthetic people and I didn't even understand it at the time.

I feel like it's taken me nine months to even really kind of  get to the next level down, but I, I'm really excited that you're here and I welcome you to say whatever you want for as long as you want, you know.  Thank you, Kris Krüg.  Thank you, everyone. Really nice to see Some of familiar faces, some of, uh, new faces.

And I have to acknowledge, I remember first or second meetup, I have to acknowledge you got bagged. But not you personally, you as an audience got bagged. Um, so, also have to acknowledge  besides Canadians, Americans, There is a Serbian here. Annoying Eastern European  Eastern European humor. This is not a moment for stand up.

So, I'm gonna switch to personas, synthetic personas, and the research I'm doing at Northeastern. So, thank you, Kris Krüg, for the introduction. My name is Mirjana Prpa. I'm a professor at Northeastern University in Vancouver. It's Northeastern, not Western, even though we are in Northwest. We get it all the time.

Um, and my research is on topics that relate to virtual reality and large language models.  How I got into VR, it's been a long time. And I got into VR because I really didn't like what I experienced in VR, and I felt we can make this better, and I feel this drive to make things better is something that keeps me going as a researcher, as an educator, as someone who's working with young talent that are super promising, um, and we focus our efforts right now on this idea that social virtual reality, you know, these Virtual reality platforms where everyone joins wearing headsets and everyone interacts and it's very complicated and complex and sometimes hostile and most of the time fun,  started being populated with these  agents.

They're LLM agents. And I got interested in that. And I said, Oh, wow, this is really interesting. Not only we have problems between people, now we're going to start having problems between people and agents. So I started focusing my research on really understanding what value will LLM agents add to very complex social dynamic that we already have in these environments.

And that's how we started. We did a lot of work on understanding what are these agents good for and the only way to really understand that was to go to the creators of these first ones. Are you familiar with Celeste AI. Some of you joking.  And we reached out to the creators right they all go on these like nicknames and you have to find a person who knows the person who knows the person, and eventually you find them. 

And then we learned. that no one knows what these things are good for. It's a big experiment. Right now, everyone is trying to understand where is the potential, where is the value.  And that's the work that we are doing also at Northeastern. The research that,  uh, we are conducting is on understanding where in these social pockets and very complex dynamic interactions we can drive value by deploying LLM agents.

And we have projects where we worked on Uh, AI moderators where, uh, we know that moderation at scale in real time is a problem, that there are not enough mo live human moderators to be in all rooms, um, in some of these platforms. So we are deploying AI agents to flag the, the content that might be characterized as hate speech.

Or, you might be using these platforms to practice. It's English, or Serbian, by talking to agents, uh, in these, um, worlds. So that is the, the, the direction that we are taking. But what we did learn through that work was that  we talk about technology and better models and faster models and that none of that actually matters. 

If it feels robotic, if it feels awkward.  If it doesn't move, even in random patterns,  you don't connect.  So, my question is, what about these micro expressions and behaviors, do we need to build in these agents to actually drive value from them? And a big, big part of my research is that. Understanding how to build that connection. 

And big part of that you, so now going back to synthetic personas, it's not about LLMs only, which it is. Big part.  But it is about personalities. What is this synthetic persona that you are creating? And what kind of values does it convey? What kind of behaviors?  We know from the research, and people have done extensive research on doing, uh, personality tests  on different LLMs.

So some of LLMs are very leftist left, and some of them are rightist right, and some of them are in the middle, and if you change the temperature, their personalities change.  So we know that. But, We don't have enough examples or evidence to know that we can claim that every time you switch settings from A to B, they're going to perform the same way.

And that's very important when you are building synthetic personas, because synthetic personas are used in research as synthetic participants. You want to understand your user, target audience, your users. You might be running synthetic personas to do that type of research.  And to do that, you need to know who you are working with. 

And we don't have those answers yet. So that's what we are trying to understand.  And as part of that research, we also understand that  Has it been eight minutes already? I've got eight minutes, and I thought this would be done in two. But I can talk, man. Okay, so, very quickly, the last part that I wanted to share  We also realized that LLMs, we know the problems, right?

Stereotypes, biases, trained on  data coming from North America, English, yada yada, right? Stereotypes. But we realized that, um,  very often in my classroom, I work with computer science students, and I teach human computer interaction class, human centered design processes. They need to work with people.  And very often it's really not the best idea to put someone, computer science person, in front of someone who might be  marginalized, grew in sensitive position, right? 

To just have them ask questions, right? To gather the requirements. So I was like, I have to figure something out. And now synthetic data and synthetic personas is a way that we go. So we have developed, um, LLM based agent that is web based interface where you can, um, interact with a, uh, persona of people, um, representing personas of people with Down syndrome.

And this work actually was really challenging.  Because LLM's period, and then bring on top of that people with Down syndrome. We have a problem here, so we've been trying to understand how to leverage small data, uh, lived experiences of people with Down syndrome shared on Twitter. different forums where they talk about their experiences to ground LLM responses in what they experience in particular context.

And that's the ongoing work that I invite you to reach out to me if you're interested in, um, in this idea or you have a use case because we have a platform ready and it doesn't have to be People with Down syndrome, but if you are specifically working with, uh, people in sensitive groups, this might be, um, an opportunity for us to even collaborate because we are looking to open the platform to other groups of, uh, people that you might need, um, to make personas for. 

Okay, I think I talked I talked a lot. 

everyone. Please reach out  if you would like to  continue the conversation. This was not a conversation, this was monologue, so if you would like a conversation. We, we have time for questions and answers if  a great question. Um, the first ethical guideline was to, um, focus on how people with Down syndrome would like to be represented.

So we started from the literature. There are different frameworks, so how they would like, right? So for example, there is ability based. The things that we don't want people to talk about. We know some people would like to have their abilities showcased rather than disabilities. We built that. Personas we built for people with Down Syndrome.

They talked about what they're capable 

capable of doing instead of what they are not capable of doing. That's one. The second one is now we are, um, working with speech and language pathologists, that was the segment we are focusing on, uh, trying to identify the stereotypes still present in the LLM output. The third part will be working with people, with the communities, with people with Down syndrome, asking,  is this true representation?

Yes, why? If it's not, how would you like to be represented in this particular case and making it scalable, right? So that people can contribute as a kind of collaborative effort of how representation should happen. 

I'm wondering how are you dealing with the matter of gender and synthetic personas,  even in this particular example?  Another great question. Um, what we realized is when we had UX designers using our platform and they would, um, indicate, let's say they're saying, okay, I'm designing for someone who is 16 year old with Down syndrome and they're female or they're male, right?

So they would set the parameters. What we didn't, uh, what we realized was that even the vocabulary, So what we realized is when we had UX designers using our platform and they would indicate, let's say they're saying, okay, I'm designing for someone who is 16 year old with Down syndrome and they're female or they're male, right?

So they would set the parameters. What we realized is that even the vocabulary, matters, how the large language model represents someone who's 16 year old. If the vocabulary is too complex, like someone who's maybe in their 40s and professional in a particular area,  and then they should be 16 year old, it does matter, and it breaks that kind of illusion that you are actually talking to the 16 year old.

That is also what we are working on, how to scale down and how to actually stylize  the language. Um, for different genders, different age groups, uh, because that's really what matters. We don't have definite answers yet. We're still experimenting. Andrew, I'm so excited to hear what you're going to ask. I'm very curious.

Um, how much training of the model do you have to have to feel like you have some percentage? Maybe what's the scale that's going to take those tasks out? Yeah, I mean, like, fuck our little competition. You could run, like, infinity competitions. I'll start somewhere. 

Well, it's like, but it's, I mean, it's, it really, anything, especially, I mean, that's a great example, you can obviously take, uh, long haul truck drivers, and it's about how much you Great question. Um, so, for confidence levels, so what we did, we fine tuned. But for me, the confidence level would be, if you're creating persona of people, 

with Down syndrome, then having people with Down syndrome veto and evaluate the model, the responses. I don't care what's happening in the background, right? But if the responses are truthful and they say, yeah, this really reflect how we experienced X in this context. To me, then I think we have something that we can release.

Right. So what's the number? Because we run all these evaluations, this model against that model, this one.  Is this truthful representation of what we want to show in terms of synthetic personas? And if that's vetted by the communities, it is a complex problem because you would have to have some sort of consensus.

So where do you make that cut off? But I think there is a lot of room for us to experiment what these platforms might look like. 

Exactly, working with speech and language pathologists, caregivers, and the communities, different perspectives and actually being able to mark which perspective you want to, to see as a result. Yeah. There's going to be more people with questions right now than I have time to give answers to. Could you say how people can get in touch with you again?

Um, that's my name. You can just  find me on LinkedIn. If you want an introduction, if I don't give you an introduction because there's something there, you can talk to me, but, uh, yeah. Yeah, and email, it's not there. It really is like, if it doesn't get here, yeah, bro, what's up, bro? How do you maintain consistency across the sessions for the same, uh, persona?

Yeah, that's a trade trade secret. Uh, we  can talk more about that. Thank you, everyone. Um, 

Thank you, Mariana. Thank you so much for everything. You're very smart and inspiring. Oh, yes!  You guys are about to witness a phenomenon.  What's up, Kush?  I 

apologize for this. Um, I, I am surprised.  Only one minute, probably. Uh, I'm surprised. How is it, like,  Whatever the date is right now, 28th, I guess, 29th  of January, 2025. And we're at an AI conference or whatever. And no one has mentioned open source. No one has mentioned DeepSeek. No one has mentioned the massive elephant in the room and people are talking about corporate interests and whatever and secrets, etc. 

Is anyone gonna bring it up? Cause if, if yes, great, if not, I just wanted to say like, what the fuck?  You know? 

Um, Keon, who works at the, um, Metacreation Lab with Philippe, those are all open source models. Um, we all know that like, open source is at the heart of what we do. I've trained two star GAN models using Philippe's tools that have only ever seen human faces that are portraits that I've given it.  And they output stuff that I completely own. 

Because of open source stuff. It's what we're all about. It's the heart of what we're doing here, bro. Do you want to give like a, like a commercial for open source real quick? Yeah. Woo! 

It's not a commercial. I guess, what I could do is, if The reason I'm trying to fuck out of this guy is because he, he speaks up at times, and he says the types of things that need to be said, and that's why  I, I, I appreciate it. All right, fine, fine, fine. Fuck it. I apologize.  Can you hold this? 

All right, fine. I'm not hijacking the event. Kris Krüg is asking me to speak. All I want to say is, uh,  I don't post on social media very much, but I realize that I'm getting a little bit annoyed about the discourse right now around DeepSeek and China and whatever. And so I was hoping that coming here I would find more people who are sort of  What is it about?

And so, but you know, we've been talking about their projects and so on, which is all great. And I didn't hear like the hype that I was expecting about the current events that are changing the landscape. And so it's why I was like, what's going on? But so on a quick low down, uh, a company from China, a group from China around like a hundred percent team launched a model, a new model that they trained for.

Fully open source. They put the model out there. They created a host service for it. They're not charging it for now But they're gonna charge start charging in like a month and There's been a lot of discourse about how China bad because it's China China, you know, and they they obviously not very smart.

It's Chinese people. Obviously like u. s. Is smart Chinese people will copy obviously  and so there's a lot of discourse right now about how  Somehow that needs to be looked at upon with with, uh, somehow suspicion or somehow it should not be used because it's messy or whatever. And I, what I want to say is open source is open source.

Open source is the, the honor, the love, the joy of sharing knowledge, of researching in open and out in the open, building upon the shoulders of others, and then just sharing all the stuff that you do. And that's what these, this team from China has done. And I hope that you all, if you already haven't, look into that, download it, use it, and understand that OpenAI and companies in the U.

S. and in our part of the world have been holding us by the balls, not letting us in on the research that should have been done for the last two years. And this team from China had to show us what the fuck is going on because they were actually willing to open source their methodology in this extremely technical research paper that, uh, me and a bunch of other people that are much smarter than me are gonna discuss in a reading group next week because it's just fun to research and then share this stuff as opposed to keep it private because profit and I don't know, whatever the car there is that Sam Altman drives.

So anyway, point is, like, let's, let's talk about that, you know? Let's talk about the things that are happening right now in the world that are changing the entire landscape and sending anybody a stalk like one trillion nose driver, whatever the fuck's going on. 

Don't go far.  Um, this is my homeboy Kushal. He's got a bunch of, uh, he's got a podcast that's great about, uh, Oh, no,  Sorry, he has a YouTube channel with things that look like podcasts about open source AI.  That's really, really good. That inspires me a lot. That I think you should check out. Is what I'm trying to say. 

Um,  I really do think he's on the right track, except he's angry. And so that's why he, he don't see that, um.  Amongst many of you, you know the things that he's talking about. We want to have these conversations. That's why we're here. We're making connections that go deeper, that bring all sorts of people in.

That, um, but that's not at the exclusion of any of that stuff. You can find that stuff online.  I'm running it on my M4 that was powering Marina's thing earlier. 

You guys, this is Wanda.  See, there's an issue. There's an issue. I've been to China as a guest of the government. They met me at the airport in Beijing with a lineup of Rolls Royces. I've made speeches in the government office in Beijing. And I'm frickin scared. And I don't want anything to do with that. 

Um, 

to  To get into the weeds of the news headlines of these things, I think, is a mistake. To understand  open source stuff versus open AI stuff, and the big picture stuff that, that, that Kushal's talking about, I think there's legitimacy there. And so, yeah, they might have had a data lake, and, and, I, there are concerns for sure about, um, government involvement, where it comes from, all that kind of stuff. 

That's what this is all about, is meeting other people. Some people are experimenting and are stoked and techno utopians. Other people got questions, concerns, are skeptics or whatever, right? And so this is a bit of a place where we can hash it out and have that conversation. Philippe, you still need to talk or can I wrap this thing up?

If you don't mind, can I respond to that briefly? In the comments, bro. He really did keep it close to one minute. And I've never seen him do that before. I do appreciate your contribution, sir. I appreciate it. 

Thank you, man.  Belief, did you have something you really need to say? Yeah. Okay. Um, the third light down over there on that little patch with the green light I think turns off everything except for the stage. 

Thanks guys for coming to this thing. Uh, I really enjoy it. It's so much fun. Uh, I try to bring you like the people I find the most interesting who are doing the most interesting stuff, who are like peers and colleagues and thinkers and going deep and so I think I just like  Consider you guys all part of that group, and I'm very happy that you're here  To wrap up tonight.

We have Brittney Smaila who came out earlier and talked a little bit about cogs and how she's getting Students to use AI in her class  Yeah, she's done several readings. She's also a poet wordsmith deep thinker and  And I'm really excited that you're here tonight. Uh, I get to do the dress rehearsals where she, uh, reads them the night before and I get to, and then this is, you've done it again.

Um, thank you so much for contributing your gifts and, um, Brittany Smiley. 

Thank you.  Um,  with, uh, hmm?  Yes. That was intentional. Uh, I wear a lot of hats. Uh, with, I was wearing a hat with  In the context of everything that was said tonight, I would like to clarify that this poem is about discernment.  Uh,  and also,  I ask permission before using the photo that you will see. 

Although the neuroscience presented herein is accurate,  this is a work of fiction.  Any resemblance to actual people, alive or dead, is entirely coincidental.  Or, events, past, present, or future,  is entirely coincidental. 

Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself? 

There's this belief that's commonly held. That the human brain matures at age 25, donning its graduation cap and hanging its fully grown brain diploma on the innards of our minds,  and looking at the people in power.  How could you be faulted for believing it?  However, aside from the obvious query of what exactly constitutes some material maturity,  age 25,  Just happened to be the upper limit of the participants in that particular study. 

And if we zoomed out, broadened our scope, we'd see continued myelination and plasticity. Our brains don't stop changing until we're dead.  And even then, they decay.  And perhaps there's an argument to be made for decayed being the most mature form that the human brain can take.  Looking at the people in power.

How could you be faulted for believing it?  There's this other commonly held belief that we only use 10 percent of our brains on any given day. This, I assure you, is demonstrably false.  But, looking at the people in power,  how could you be faulted for believing it?  Those fragile men, whose demons keep them on a tight leash, seeking to be called patriarchs, call me daddy, but give me all the accountability of a child. 

Or better yet, some god, devoid of checks or balances, whose lack of care for his flock is excused, because our brains are obviously too small, too immature, to see. The master plan in place for our  greatest good. 

Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  If we only use 10 percent of our brains, maybe,  we won't have to admit how many brains just don't seem to be that useful.  With every juvenile tantrum deemed that of a genius, Phonetic words.  And flailing arms defended, somehow respected,  a repetulant petition for power declared, some strategic move in a game of 5 D chess. 

Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  Silence and stifling a laugh often look the same. But now is no longer the time for restraint. See, I've been busy, remote viewing through that stargate. I've been jumping through time and space, and sticking my fingers so far up my nose, they rearrange the contents of my brain, thinking maybe, if I reverse it, throw deuces, as my eyes hit that filthy floor, maybe I will see what got them through the door. 

Look.  I saw the chaos, too.  I felt it, too.  But when they came knocking, asking, Is it me you're looking for?  Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  Oh, God.  Daddy's got a mandate. He's calling the shots. He's wearing robes and stirring the pot. And we've got robots now recreating images based on human brainwaves.

With near perfect accuracy.  And I will remind you of the stepwise order of literacy. First you learn to read, and then you learn to write.  Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself?  Oh God.  With every brainwave read,  dissected,  written,  and inserted.  You will find me clinging to I for dear life. 

Grasping at the last scraps of multiplicity until these knees bend themselves independent of me and we surrender  to the most mature form  the human brain can take. That singularity.  And our unquestioningly,  incomprehensibly,  Irrevocably, inevitably, 

happy about it.  Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself? 

Happy Lunar New Year. Be a nuisance to power for as long as you can. Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you.  Um, I showed you guys some of the most interesting things I've seen lately. I'm so happy to have you guys participate. Thank you for your participation. Um,  thank you for being here.  We got like an hour left to hang out. Actually, hang out downstairs for half an hour. About 9. 30 we're gonna kind of go upstairs and start to move the party that direction.

Also, I have one more parental type of thing I gotta say is like,  when we first got this place and did the contract that I told you was so important to me, uh, they said we couldn't drink in here.  And now they let us drink in here because we're respectful. We're cool.  So, could you guys just like, clean up after your neighbor and yourself and just like, like leave this place sweet? 

And like, if somebody's asked you at some point to go upstairs at 930 or whatever, 945, like just do it or help out. Just do what you can, because these people are awesome.  This is, yeah.  Lucy, if you're here, Lorraine, if you're here, we really appreciate you. We appreciate your team, Michael Unger, all the Space Center folks.

You guys are awesome. So, um, yeah, look after each other. Thanks for coming. Hey, uh, one more thing, a couple more things. We have a film screening here a week from tonight, The Thinking Game. There's a community like ours out of San Francisco called the AI Salon. We're doing a collaboration with them here.

It's a feature film that didn't have a Vancouver premiere. That we have one on this, this screen right here. It's about a Google DeepMind. I watched it twice. It's fucking awesome. It's like, uh, like, if you like the AlphaGo documentary, it's that, the next thing, like, five years later. It's really good. Then the meetup, uh, Feb 26th, a month from now ish.

Um, if you guys get tickets earlier it helps us make things more awesome. We can commit to more shit. We can like, yeah. So buy your tickets earlier if you can. Thank you for being here. The donuts are ready. 

Thank you, sir. Um, yeah, like Space Center is, um, listen guys. They got this dome upstairs and they want to offer it to us. They want us to be, they want Kevin to be able to do his crazy shit on the dome. And a part of that is like, uh, refurbishing the infrastructure of this place. Like, it's a, a suite building on the beach with old gear.

And so, a part of actually why I'm here is to help them  think of awesome, creative, new ideas that can bring in funding and stuff. But support the Space Center. They got monthly subscriptions available. Bring your kids or whatever. Talk to Lorraine when you're here. Like, they're, they're supporting us and trying to do something.

So yeah, hook them up and help them out wherever you can. Thank you. Do you want to say anything other than that?  Alright.  Annual memberships. 

I'm gonna buy one. And I'm gonna buy Kevin one.  So now we're signed up for two.  Let's see what we can do guys. Um, three. Three. Alright. Um, Donuts are out. My homeboy Bryce,  God damn it.  Um,  Do you just for like one quick sec want to talk about the esoteric AI system that you're training? He picked up the doughnuts for me because I was too busy today. 

Alright, a quickie. So,  I've been spending the last five years diving into human consciousness. How do we rewrite the beliefs, the deeper structures, the identities that keep us doing the same stupid shit over and over again. How do we rewrite that so we can live better lives? So over the last month or two, mostly been with GPT 4, just been feeding it all of the research I've been doing,  all of the textbooks that I've learned from, and using it to start teasing out how it can get better at  becoming who we already are. 

And that's really what it is. It's the name of the game.  I love it. I, I love it because there's all sorts of people in our community using it for all sorts of different things. My very first chat GPT epiphany moment was like, an auto mechanic friend was using it to fix his business. Another guy was using it to translate an Italian text.

Somebody else was using it to do marketing for their company. I was like, what is this technology that all these people who aren't really geeks, uh, you know,  it's got them so stoked or whatever. So that was like,  I can't wait to see your model. I've got my one friend who trained her  product. Izzy Egan is a member of our community.

She has a product called, uh, HannaHR that just came out this week. She's looking for testers.  We can connect you with her. But she trained, um, models on, uh, 10, 000 hours of her own proprietary HR consulting with one on one clients that isn't released out there on the internet. It's like a data goldmine, right?

Like, you can have what ChatGPT says. Or you can have Izzy Egan's unique perspective that was successful for these people, you know, and now so she's launched a  Subscription service that is like literally just coming out right under our noses right now but the types of things you guys are up to gets me really excited because you're taking these, um, Bodies of knowledge that are unique and proprietary you're applying AI to them You're squeezing all the juice out and you're seeing what's out there, you know, and so thanks Bryce.

Thanks for picking up the doughnuts Thanks for being awesome  I'm gonna keep talking unless someone shuts the mic off Kevin  Turns on some music. Thanks for coming, guys. Applause
