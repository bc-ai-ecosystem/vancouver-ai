## Opening Remarks & Financial Update
**Host:** Kris Krüg

We've got some sponsors that I'm gonna thank later, but us supporting our own community over the last 18 months, essentially buying ourselves our own drinks and buying each other drinks as opposed to selling this off to Microsoft or KPMG has allowed us to develop a strong personality, a strong community sensibility, and to really define who we are before money sucks all the air out of the room. Money's knocking at the door and wants to be a part of this, and they're gonna be allowed to on our terms.

I didn't expect to talk about that right now. I don't wanna mix the Sacred with the profane. Before we get started, my friend jonny williams from the Squamish Nation - we've been doing this 19 months in a row. The first nine months we were at my studio and Johnny, when we were just 80 people, even more ragtag than we are today, was there with his family helping welcome us into these ceremonies in a good way.

I'm really excited about the program tonight. We're gonna do a group meditation based on the data set that we are running through our hackathon right now about our collective hopes and dreams for AI. And we got my friend Michael, who's done 52 startups in the last 52 weeks, talking about how to kill your babies and invent, reinvent your coding methodology every six months.

This place is shaped like the Coast Salish hat, and so it makes us think about that as we come in here into this round room.

## Indigenous Welcome & AI Usage
**Speaker:** Jonathan Williams (Squamish Nation)

Hello. My name's Jonathan Williams. I come from the Squamish Nation. I'm also from Cree descent as well. I reside in a village known as North Yards in the Squamish Valley. In my heart I'd like to say I'm a respectful person and I wanted to raise my hands and say, I'm grateful for you guys for being here today.

I also wanted to thank Chase Young or our creator for the beautiful day we have today and for all the blessings that he gives us.

### Chief's Honor Song Story
The song that I'll be sharing as the opening today will be Hope Chafe. It is known as the Chief's Honor song. In 1906 chief Joe Capano among I think it was 10 other chiefs, went to England and they went to go speak with the king. They wanted to go plead our case. They wanted to let him know that we're still here, that we're humans as well. We have our own culture and we have hopes and dreams too, and that we just want to live here.

In our stories, this is one of the songs that they told. I was told when they went to go, when they first went there, they weren't allowed in. And this is the song they sung while they were outside the gate. And the queen thought it was so beautiful that they deemed that they could be humans. So they eventually let them in and they had conversations.

[Song performed]

In that song you see me raise my hands and in our culture to raise our hands known as Kayin. It means to thank you. It means as a thank you or it means as a welcome. I want to welcome you guys to our territory. The place known as Greater Vancouver was once known as Kom Kamai in our language that means place of many maples.

Unfortunately, we don't have the same kind of authority over the land as we used to, but we still want to live together and have connections moving forward.

### AI Usage in Cultural Advisory Work
Recently I used to work as a cultural advisor for the Rights and Title team for the Squamish Nation. Essentially what I did is I'd go over documents from businesses, governments, and any personal people who wanted information about Squamish Nation and what often would it be? Would it be community plans? 

They often have lots and lots of pages and often you can't always add to it or change it. So it's very hard to figure out exactly what needed to be done. So what I was doing, I would plug in the 250 to 300 pages and then I would ask exactly what as a culture advisor - 'cause I've used it a bunch before, so it learned more from me and other things that I've done previously. So I asked what, as a culture advisor named Jonathan Williams, who works for the Squamish Nation, what kind of things should he advise on, what pages they're on?

And then I'd go to those pages to make sure that they're right. And then I would advise on whatever it could be. Most of the time it's artwork or interpretive features nowadays, 'cause we're often not involved at the start of the planning. But now since businesses and people like yourselves have been connecting with us more, we get put at the start of the plan.

**Language Context:** There's probably like 60 of us [who speak Squamish at toddler level]. Fluent speakers - there's probably like seven.

**Political Update:** I'm running for our Squamish Nation Chief and Council, and I just used AI to help me write all of my references and as well as my platform. Just got approved to be a candidate for the council, and elections will be on 28th of September.

**Cultural Note:** In our language, we don't really have a "please, thank you, I love you." A big part of it is we are very big on respect. If anybody ever asks you to do anything, if you truly love them, you're gonna do it for them because they would do it for you. So there's no reason for you to say please or thank you.

## Community Announcements

### Mind AI and Consciousness Group
**Speakers:** Loki, Suzanne Gilbert, Finn, Gabe

#### Science of Consciousness Conference Report
**Loki:** I went to Barcelona. There in Barcelona was five and a half days of the Science of Consciousness Conference. This is a 30th annual conference. It's been alternating between Arizona and places in the European Union. This year it was in Barcelona and they aligned it with the Festival of Consciousness.

**Suzanne Gilbert (Quantum Physicist):** I did a talk at the Science of Consciousness Conference about quantum consciousness and how to test it in robots. When I went up to do that talk, I was nervous, but I was nowhere near as nervous as when I had to introduce Sir Roger Penrose on the next talk session. He was joining remotely to give his talk. He talked about quantum physics, quantum consciousness and collapse of the wave function and how that can make conscious choices.

**Conference Intensity:** Five and a half days from 8:30 until 4, then 5 to 7:30 were the concurrent sessions. And then 8 to 10 o'clock were the poster sessions for five days straight.

**Plenary Speakers:** The ending plenary was Donald Hoffman (user illusion theorist), followed by Deepak Chopra on consciousness as a fundamental aspect of the universe, then Frederico Faggin (semiconductor originator who had a life-changing experience that led him into a consciousness journey).

#### Apple Paper Discussion
**Finn:** The last meetup was about the Apple paper called "The Illusion of Thinking." It raised quite a lot of news and discussion. It's saying these models are breaking down at some level when you try and give them increasingly complex tasks. We were interested in talking about what happens as they break down.

The paper was essentially saying "it's a party trick" - everything you think is AGI is a party trick. Our analysis was that the analysis they did for the paper was also a party trick.

**Gabe:** This group is really serious and it was an honor to be invited because we got the chance to talk about very serious topics. We got to read intense papers and try to find reason and understand how AI is going to impact mind, AI and consciousness. We discuss things that AI can't do - like [claps with one hand] - this aspect of consciousness that AI just can't do yet.

The in-person groups are maxed out, but people can join the WhatsApp group for discussions and link sharing.

### Surrey AI
**Speakers:** Matthew and Riv

This group runs smaller, half-price events in Surrey at the Legion Hall. Everybody gets to speak with everybody. Next meetup will be their sixth one, held in the park. They've grown quite the community with people who can't always make it into the city.

**September Event:** Next month they're shaking it up - going to the park for open networking, games, fun snacks and food.

### Community Sponsorships
**Cassandra (Link Ladders/Frontier Collective):** Announcing sponsorship of five tickets for the next AI meetup for anyone under age 22 or over age 65, plus $250 for the next Surrey AI meetup for food or beer.

**Video Message from Cassandra's Mother (Rita, age 74):** "Hi Kris Krüg, it's Rita. I hope you guys have a wonderful time tonight. I'm sorry I can't come, but the next time you have an event, I would love to attend again. My mother is a very heavy AI user at 74 years old. We're never too young and we're never too old."

## Upcoming Events

### SIGGRAPH Conference Tie-ins
**Dates:** August 10-14, 2024

**Informal Meetup:** August 9th at 4pm at Alibi Room - "Find your Own Table" style meetup (100+ people signed up)

**Patrick's Event:** August 12th at 8:30pm (sold out, but 3 tickets available for commitment tonight). Frank from Berg Bakery will cater and create a new recipe with AI as a user test.

**Quote from Patrick:** "AI is dead, long live AI."

**Kris Krüg's Commentary:** Vancouver has been excellent at courting big international events. We had NIPS last year with 15,000 people, ICLML last week. At both conferences you had Jeffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Sam Altman - the world's foremost thinkers and leaders coming here. SIGGRAPH is another one where the people who hold the patents, the PhDs, the people who think of this stuff and make it all up are all coming here.

### YouTube Channel Growth
**Kevin (Mr. Pixel):** We've got 800 subscribers in three or four months, which is pretty good since there's only 225 people in this room. Alan Pike's video went viral with 30,000 views, owing us about half our subscribers.

## Rival Technologies Hackathon
**Presenter:** Andrew Reed (Rival Technologies)

We are running a big hackathon sponsored by Rival Technologies. Andrew Reed is the son of Angus Reed - his company acquired his father's company, Angus Reed Forums. They're the survey people in Canada, and now they're innovating on taking survey results and using AI to turn them into different stories.

### First Two Round Winners Present

#### Sev (First Round Winner)
**Project 1:** Building inference infrastructure at the edge in Canada - "CloudFlare for AI" called Polar Grid. Two inference servers/edge servers with L40s, putting nodes across Canada (one in Ottawa, one in Vancouver).

**Project 2:** Economy of Wisdom Foundation - laying down financial infrastructure for the most underprivileged communities, integrating with distributed ledger called Interledger Foundation to give downtown Vancouver side access to funds for basic necessities.

#### Matt Sinclair (Second Round Winner) 
**Canadian Identity Simulator:** Built with English degree, no coding knowledge - pure vibe coding. The project asks "What does it mean to be Canadian?" and interprets survey results to build an identity simulator.

**Impact:** Kris Krüg showed this in his Google AI lab for journalists. Cajuns from Lafayette, Louisiana connected with it immediately and wanted to build Cajun identity simulators. This led to Louisiana potentially hiring Matt to build a Cajun identity simulator.

**Key Point:** "I won and I don't know how to code. So that's how easy it is these days."

### Current Round (Round 3)
**Data:** Asking 1,000 British Columbians about their hopes and fears and dreams about AI in the future.

**Secret Preview:** "They don't trust corporations or government to be their bridge into the future. There's a lot of skepticism. They're looking for groups like this. They're looking for communities of people rising up from the bottom to figure out and go on a journey together."

**Prizes:** $2,500 plus special dinner (previous dinner was at Boulevard with sommelier)

**How to Participate:** Go to GitHub, grab the CSV, stick it in ChatGPT, ask "what's in this file," then let your imagination go.

## Keynote: AI Energy Usage Monitoring
**Speaker:** Lionel Ring (WhatsApp Project)

### Project Background
WhatsApp is a project aimed at "shining a light on AI energy use." Started after presenting here in January about understanding the scale of AI energy consumption.

**Core Problem:** AI is ubiquitous and uses energy-intensive hardware everywhere. There is no reporting at all on what energy is being used, creating no awareness.

**Why It Matters:**
- AI is becoming invisible in many applications through clever UX
- Energy demand is probably going parabolic, but we can't know without numbers
- Energy usage has direct correlation with climate change
- We need to identify efficient vs. inefficient uses of AI

### Research Findings
**GitHub Copilot Study:** "Green my LLM" paper found that 55% of all AI requests in coding editors are never used - just sent and discarded due to UX patterns like auto-complete requesting on every keystroke.

**Tool Development:** Built extension for Visual Studio Code that:
- Shows real-time energy usage of AI requests
- Provides dashboard with hourly/daily/monthly analytics
- Uses "microwave hours" as relatable energy metric
- Available as open-source fork on GitHub

### Demonstration Results
One development session with the bot = running a microwave for 20 hours nonstop.

### Policy Context & Concerns  
**Recent Development:** Donald Trump decided that environmental rules for building data centers don't apply if they're for AI - no environmental review needed for impact on local population, water, or grid.

**Corporate Transparency Issues:** Big tech companies don't want us to know energy numbers, making the need for measurement tools more critical.

### Future Plans
- **Mu Tech Exhibition:** August 20th in Montreal
- **Data Collection:** Enable aggregated energy counter across users  
- **Tool Integration:** Expand to ComfyUI, Ollama, and other AI tools
- **Newsletter:** Subscribe for updates and participation opportunities

### Q&A Highlights

**Visualization Question:** How to make energy numbers relatable and actionable? Need efficiency metrics like "30 of 100 requests were completely discarded" so users can improve workflows.

**Kris Krüg's Perspective:** Having lived off-grid with solar power, actual energy constraints forced real trade-off decisions (watching YouTube vs. charging laptop vs. electric coffee maker). Without numbers, we can't rationalize whether a prompt is worth asking or if there's a better way.

**Kush's Challenge:** Argued for abundance mindset over scarcity - focus on local inference rather than cloud APIs, smaller models, owning your own compute rather than renting from "rent seekers." The scarcity is artificial, created by providers who want your money.

**Lionel's Response:** Agrees about efficiency and local options, but current default tools don't offer local alternatives. Most people don't have deep enough knowledge to choose local inference over cloud services.

## Keynote: AI Coding Agents & 52 Startups
**Speaker:** Michael (YaDev)

### Background
Built 52 startups in 52 weeks after selling previous company, trying to figure out what to work on next. Took 12 startups in 16 weeks to figure out what to work on (AudioWave - text to high quality audio), then stopped because no more learning.

This year went to SF startup, tried building "second brain AI," then Claude Code came out with new ideas.

### Core Thesis: Speed vs. Quality
**Initial Assumption:** AI makes us faster at building things.
**Reality Check:** We deliver more outputs, but not more outcomes or polished apps that people actually care about.

**Customer Perspective:** Customers don't care if you have 5 people or thousands building your app (like Spotify). They want solutions to their problems delivered beautifully and simply.

### Two Key Concepts

#### 1. Paul Graham's Viaweb (1995)
Built first web app (predecessor to Shopify) and could ship things so fast they could fix bugs for customers during phone calls. This wasn't about technology - it was about keeping things simple.

#### 2. Leverage Principle
Like a lever - increase output with same input. Balance between:
- **Extending leverage:** Building better tools
- **Reducing scope:** Making the "rock" smaller, reducing friction

### Practical Examples

#### Language Support Feature
**Customer Request:** "What languages do you support?"
**Solution Attempted:** 4.5 hours to build proper multi-language interface
**Better Solution:** Could have just added to FAQ in 5 minutes

**Lesson:** Sometimes you don't need to go to the complexity. You can always do it later.

#### Claude Code Search Implementation
Instead of fancy state-of-the-art RAG with separate data store and indexing, Claude team just used simple Unix tools (find, grep). It was "just good enough" and still in use.

### Common Startup Trap
Start wanting to "conquer the world" - work on every platform everywhere all the time, but end up working nowhere really. Example: SF startup originally forking Linux, then Android, then Mac app, then Windows, using four programming languages. "No amount of AI could help us with that."

**Solution:** Simplified to just Swift UI and TypeScript with basic Swift UI knowledge plus Claude Code.

### Tool Evolution Timeline
1. **GitHub Copilot:** Comment → function generation (limited, user retains control)
2. **ChatGPT:** Full script generation, copy/paste into code
3. **IDE Integration:** Cursor, Windsurf - conversation inside code editor
4. **Agentic Flows:** Code generation → compilation/parsing → error correction loops
5. **Claude Code:** Start with task rather than code, "I'm a project manager now"

### Software Evolution Framework
- **1.0:** Traditional programming (if/then, very rigid, predictable)
- **2.0:** Machine learning (data → neural net training for specific tasks)
- **3.0:** Generative AI (general purpose, can do anything)

**Key Insight:** 3.0 can generate so much 1.0 code that humans can't review it (125,000 line pull requests). Need to specialize 3.0 back to 2.0 for specific tasks.

### Practical Workflow Examples

#### Multiple Parallel Sessions
Run 4-5 Claude Code sessions simultaneously, switching between them. Friends run 10+ parallel sessions. Give each a task, switch between them, ship as much as possible.

#### Ship Everything
- Boring stuff (health documents, marketing material, metrics)
- Variants (like image model 4-grid squares, but for features)
- Overnight automation (run tasks while sleeping)
- Data-driven experimentation (PostHog MCP integration)

### Workflow Details
1. **Start with Linear ticket:** Simple task breakdown
2. **Think first:** Write down what you want, how to implement it (don't outsource thinking)
3. **Use Claude Code:** Dangerously run without permissions (no crypto on machine)
4. **Generate plan:** Review and remove unnecessary complexity
5. **Execute:** Automated testing, screenshot critiques for UI
6. **Tools:** Caffeinate (keep Mac awake), Cyrus (Linear→Claude Code automation)

### Quality Control Methods
- **Automated testing:** Write test first, ensure it fails, then write implementation
- **UI Screenshots:** Take screenshot, critique against requirements  
- **Code Review:** Ask AI to review its own work (limited success)
- **Evals:** Create benchmarks for LLM-heavy software to prevent degradation

### Cognitive Concerns
**MIT Study Results:** Prolonged ChatGPT use for essay writing showed:
- Reduced brain activation and critical thinking
- "Soulless essays without understanding"  
- After being forbidden from using ChatGPT, users couldn't produce essays like control group
- **Permanent effect:** "Use it or lose it" for critical thinking

**Solution:** Don't outsource your thinking. Write initial task yourself, think about solution, then have LLM help improve it.

### Tool Recommendations
- **Claude Code:** Main agent ($200/month, 29 days left before replacement needed)
- **Cursor:** Q&A and specific questions
- **Windsurf:** (switched back to Cursor due to too many rules)
- **Repo Prompt:** Save everything in markdown files, query with business context
- **Voice Mode:** Walking + ChatGPT voice for strategy discussions
- **Cyrus:** Linear ticket automation
- **Caffeinate:** Keep computer awake for overnight tasks

### Example Results
**Peter Levels Game:** Vibe-coded game generated over $100K in revenue
**Triple A Game Designer:** Used AI for asset generation while maintaining game mechanics expertise
**Pull Request Example:** Fixed 8-month-old image import bug by moving single line of code + adding tests

### Constraints & Reality
**Time Constraint:** "You can never buy more time" - use time constraints to force simplicity and scope reduction.

**Claude Code Limitations:** Anthropic threatening to shut down due to 5% of users (likely referring to heavy usage), will need open source alternatives.

**Management Challenge:** Multiple agents working on same codebase creates merge conflicts and complexity.

### Q&A Highlights

**Multi-agent Workflow:** Runs multiple workspaces on different ports, merges pull requests afterward. Aims for small changes (100-500 lines max, not 125,000 line monsters).

**New Graduate Advice:** Start with small problems that don't need tools, gradually add complexity and tools as problems get harder. Don't have FOMO about throwing out entire workflow.

**Longest Runtime:** Has run overnight (4+ hours), uses Caffeinate to keep computer awake.
