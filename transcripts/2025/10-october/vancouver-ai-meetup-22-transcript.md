## Opening & Indigenous Welcome

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Hey everybody. Welcome, welcome. You're at the Vancouver AI Community Meetup number 22. You are the Vancouver AI community. Welcome everybody. It's really nice to see everyone and to see so many new, friendly faces. If it's your first time at one of these meetups tonight, would you raise your hand, please?

I'm gonna say that's like 40%. If you're not the first time, if you've been here lots, raise your hand. Who more people have come back than are new, but it's like 40, 60. If you're a BC AI member, raise your hand. Holy shit, this thing didn't even exist a couple months ago. Congratulations. Thank you guys.

We'll talk more about that later, but that's fucking awesome. Um, okay. You guys know how we like to get started here. We start in ceremony and so I've invited my buddy [[jonny williams]], who you know, um, to come back here. Since you've seen him last, things have changed a little bit. He has been, um, voted in as a Squamish Nation counselor.

Congratulations, Johnny, man. We're really proud of you, bro. And, um, he brought with him his cousin, uh, Anthony Joseph. Anthony and I, uh, know each other from the tribal journeys you've heard me talk about. It's where Johnny and I know each other from. And, um, without much further ado, I'm just gonna welcome you guys. Come up here and just kinda say whatever you want.

**Anthony Joseph (Coast Salish, Squamish Nation):**
Thank you. Uh, to die off a, uh, ca to work test to, to, uh, to teeth seats. So I just wanted to, uh, raise my hands and thanks to everyone for being here today. What I just shared with you is, um, hello. Uh, I, uh, I, I just wanted to share it with you guys. Uh, it's a good way to ice break. What, uh, what, what I said to you was, uh, my name is, uh, Anthony Joseph, but my ancestral name is Lea. I share that with my younger brother Russell, and my cousin Nigel from my, the name of family and Nanaimo. Uh, I was blessed to grow up in Squamish.

And yeah, I, I, I, what I shared with you guys is, uh, I, uh, I raised my hands to nephew and, and, dear, dear friend Kris Krüg, uh, for inviting me. I know, uh, this is probably the fourth time I think Kris Krüg has asked me, and I, I was always busy, but, uh, like you shared earlier, I'm on council now. So it frees up the schedule and, uh, we, uh, we, we love to do, uh, share who we are and where we come from. So, I, I, uh, I thanked him in our Squamish language, and I thank, uh, raise my hands to each and every one of you guys for being here today. Time is our greatest asset, and that's the one thing you can't get back no matter where you spend it. Just, uh, thankful for that and for you to have that open heart, open mind to, uh, accept us, but also to, uh, to, to, to be open to what we have to share today. Um, yeah. So it's a, it's an honor to, to come here and do the good work.

**[[jonny williams]] (Squamish Nation Counselor):**
Uh, hello, uh, my name's Jonathan Williams. If you haven't seen me before, your Spanish is getting good. Uh, as Anthony said, I am now a Squamish Nation counselor as well. We recently got voted in last month.

Uh, Anthony, he's actually been one of my mentors since I was a little kid. I first met him when I was like eight or nine and have been learning from him ever since. He's also a Yo Knight in the dance group that we both practice in, where I've learned from Wealth Tomaso known as culture, bringing people together. He's a Yo Knight, which is known as a lead singer, and he's also, uh, a speaker within our community who's asked to be, uh, a person who stands in front of the people and speaks for the family who's doing the work. So today since uh, we have the opportunity for Anthony to be here, I was gonna let Anthony lead the show and I decide to.

**Anthony Joseph:**
Today I just, uh, thanked them for the good work and, uh, sharing the, in the language as well. Just wanted to, uh, share that. Usually when we do, uh, a lot of these, uh, songs, it's um. There's a meaning behind each of these songs. So the song that we're gonna sing to you guys today is a song that's also a blessing, but also medicine. The Tto solums snowbird song. Um, and the, the Tto Solum is a song we that, that comes from Lia, Donna Billy. So raise her hands to, for, to Donna for allowing us to share this song. 'cause it's such a powerful song in medicine, but also a song, a blessing. So hopefully, uh, and that, and we use this a lot when we do openings as well. So it's a bless you guys and your night, your journey. Um, a lot of times when we do traditional work, we call upon witnesses. So you become the human recorder, you record everything here, and you go home and you share it. So I know we're not doing that tonight, but I, I challenge you to, to go home, take what you, what you learned also, uh, to, um, what you, what you like, loved, and share that with your family and friends. Just wanted to, uh, put that out there. So, uh, yeah. So without further ado, ancho, aunt knows John and.

[Traditional Squamish song performed]

**Anthony Joseph:**
So, uh, everyone, thank you guys for your open heart, open mind. Just wanted to also, uh, thanks for reminding me to, uh, welcome you guys to the territory that we know as now. Uh, um, it's a, it's an honor and a privilege. It's, uh, and, and, uh, thank you, uh, once again to our dear friend Kris Krüg for allowing us to share who we are, where we come from, uh, with you guys today, and also the, bless you guys. Hopefully those blessings carry on even to today.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Before this was the space center, before this was Kitsilano. Before this was Vancouver. This was Squamish land, and these folks, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents ancestors, lived here for a long time and they're not gone. They're still here, they're alive and they're thriving in modern life. They're building those buildings across the street, and I encourage you to learn about it. Akwa with the W at the end. Look it up. There's a lot of interesting stuff in the news. Thanks guys for connecting us with the land, for setting us off on the right foot. I really appreciate you both being here.

## Rival Technologies Hackathon - Round 4 Finale

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
So many emails, so many notifications, so many phone calls. Go into making this thing up. Like, it's crazy how many volunteers, how many people, how many buttons get pushed to make this happen. And it's stressful. And when Anthony, and, and, and when Johnny comes up every month and starts singing it, I know everything that happens next is gonna be, okay, we're here. We made it, we're in the right place. Whoever showed up are the right people who just show up. Whatever happens tonight is the right stuff that's gonna happen.

Okay. Uh, rival folks. Would you guys like to do the, the, the, the comments, the kind of like presentation part before the award winners or after?

We can do it now if you want. Okay. So a lot of you guys know we've been running a hackathon with Rival for four rounds over eight months, and we are wrapping it up tonight. So we're wrapping up round four. We're giving out 2,500 tonight to the winner of the AI storytelling hackathon. Come on up. These guys are executives and one of the most interesting companies of Vancouver, um, their CEO came to me in January and was like, we love what's going on here. We wanna be a part of it. Let's go on this, uh, AI data storytelling journey together. So we have, we've, we have haphazardly thrown together a hackathon for the first time, and now we are, we're at the end. We've given away 7,500. We have three winners. We're gonna give the fourth one away tonight.

**Dale (Rival Technologies - Design & Innovation Lead):**
Hello everybody. And there's a, a whole bunch of new folks in the room today. So, hi, I'm Dale. This is Julia. Um, she's our, uh, VP of customer experience. Uh, I lead the design and innovation program at Rival, rival as the corporate sponsor for the hackathon we've been doing for the last six months.

And so I'd just like to thank everybody for being here today. This is such a great event. Thanks for being here to celebrate, uh, our fourth round winners. Um, and this is the end of the hackathon for us. Uh, six months ago we kicked this thing off with an idea, which was, can we take a data set, something you would typically see in an Excel file or a dashboard, and can we make it feel more alive? Can we could feel more human? Can we bring some creativity to the storytelling side of the market research space?

Um, and you know, we're about to celebrate round four, and I can say after about six months of doing this, the answer to that question is yes, it's been a fantastic ride. It's been really, really inspiring to be, uh, to be a part of this community and to see the creativity that's coming out of it.

[Dale reflects on the four hackathon rounds - hot dogs/sandwiches debate, Canadian identity, AI in BC, and music]

At every step of the way we've sort of built on top of some really great creative outcomes. And, uh, it's been a real wonderful journey. Super, super proud. And I would say that, you know, reflecting on the biggest thing that's come outta this, the work obviously, but also the community has come together around the work has been the really big, uh, win. We've seen, um, artists connect with scientists. We've seen storytellers connect with filmmakers, we've seen musicians connect with engineers. Um, we've seen what happens when creative technologists connect around, uh, a creative idea and, and not just about competition, but collaboration.

**Julia (Rival Technologies - VP Customer Experience):**
Yeah. So, uh, somebody who, you know, I look at kind of traditional data storytelling every day in my job. It was very cool to see some of the creative ideas, and I just wanna thank everybody who submitted throughout all four rounds. Thank you so much. I know a lot of time and effort was put into your project, so we really appreciate that. It was really nice to see the creativity and, uh, to quote one of the previous winners, I think he said, I wanna get this right. Are you ready to stop reading about the data and start experiencing it? I really liked that, that stuck with me. So thank you to SEB for that.

### Hackathon Round 4 Winner Presentations

#### Honorable Mention: Scott Larson - "Pixel Wizard"
[Video presentation showing creative data interpretation through metal music lens, featuring respondents' music preferences, including the oldest respondent (92) and their Tom Lehrer appreciation, various demographic breakdowns with musical preferences]

**Scott Larson (30-second reflection):**
Well, uh, to me this a sampling size of a thousand respondents to a music survey I thought was just like a really boutique thing in a business that's become box, just become so, um, you know, big data driven. And so music's a way that I wasted a huge part of my youth. And so it's really easy for me to look through a thousand responses and see who the cool people are, or just see something like, um, like the, like the Tom Lehrer. I never heard of this guy in there and now he's killing pigeons. So it was really fun. I appreciate, um, you know, all of the organizers of the Hackathon because it was music was a really cool data set for me to check out. And I thought, if you're gonna look for outliers, who's a bigger outlier than the person who paints their face to go to a metal show? Right.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Congratulations, man. The whole, um, the whole challenge was to take it and reinterpret it to you knew stuff with it man. And so just the way that you told the stories around it, like it meant a lot to me. I loved it.

#### Second Place: [[Darby Yule]] - "Signals: The Future of Sound"
[Video presentation using futures method to predict music landscape in 2030, featuring Dr. Veek (cultural historian from 2225), AI-generated music samples representing predicted genres: Hybrid Local Pop, At-Core Velocity Worship, Retro-Futurism, and Lo-fi Therapy Pop]

**[[Darby Yule]]:**
Yeah, I wasn't sure it was gonna land either. Um, yeah, so this was just, uh, basically a futures project. It's something I learned when I was going through university of just, uh, making, educated guesses, extremely educated guesses, um, off of data sets. And so I thought this was a perfect thing. Um, I think mixed with, uh, yeah, as you kind of saw, uh, the further you get out from the middle, the crazier it gets, like lo-fi therapy pop. Um, and yeah, I, I, yeah. Thank you again to Kris Krüg and, and and rival for putting this on. I was so glad just to be a part of it. Um, oh yeah. Also, I made all of the, um, album covers with, uh, those are all generative people, uh, with between me and Adobe, basically.

**[[Kris Krüg]] (on generative music as a musician):**
Musicians of which you are and other people in the audience, you must have some feelings about all this stuff. So like, after, just like stepping aside from the project and all this, how are you feeling as a musician right now about the state of generative music?

**[[Darby Yule]]:**
Oh, that's a big question. My punk rock heart wants to say, I want everything to be just like strictly human. But then there's like another part of me that goes, musicians haven't even totally accepted synthesizers yet, and those are made in the sixties. So I think that there's room for it. I just, I think it's, it's, you know, it's the same thing with everything. It's how you do it. Technology isn't bad, it's just the way you use it, right?

#### Grand Prize Winner: Andre & Taras - "Ukrainian Mafia" - Canadian Music DNA Platform
[Video presentation showing an AI-powered platform that creates personalized music profiles through a questionnaire, assigns personas based on Canadian music survey data, provides music recommendations, and generates custom music suggestions]

**Andre:**
Thank you everyone. Uh, actually I'm a more good listener, so today is my time to speak. But yeah, uh, I'm very happy to be part of Vancouver community. It's like one of my favorites in Vancouver. And, uh, yeah, sorry about my emotions. But yeah, we were trying to do something creative. Nice. So we created like a different persona with, um, using the survey data. And we combined different tools. We tried, like during the preparation, we tested many things. It includes some also like text generation, API, key, uh, connection and many, many different things. Then we also include, uh, some data analytics for visualization. And, uh, in total we created like that you, if you test it, it's also uploaded, uh, to Vercel so everyone can try.

**Taras:**
Yeah. So what I want to add, so at the, at the end of that project, we want to show how like regular person can become a singer or have its own album in a second with using just AI power. So you can come up fills, uh, questionnaire that we have and after like two or three minutes you can have a music album with couple like 10 to 15 songs with lyrics and other things. And there is no need for you to even sing. But we didn't have chance to finish all of that. And we provide what we have for now. It was our like, further idea mainly.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Andre, thank you for helping clean up, for, set up for bringing all your friends around, man. These AI letters right here. [SIGGRAPH letters story] These guys, um, David, Monty, are you here? This is yours. Take it home with you. Don't cash it. You'll hit me up for real money. David. Monty, are you here? Do you remember that time where I was like, guys, I have to leave for half an hour. Right in the middle of a very important meeting. And it was like the most idiosyncratic thing ever. I just got up. I'm like, I don't usually do this, but I must, I gotta go. No questions. These guys were like, we're in the loading dock. We stole the SIGGRAPH letters. We want to use them on the stage of Vancouver AI.

#### Hall of Fame Induction: Prajwal (Second Place All Four Rounds)
[Video presentation of Plato AI - philosophical approach to analyzing free response data using Socrates and Glaucon dialogue format]

**Prajwal:**
Hello everyone. My name is Prajwal and I would like to show you Plato AI, my Hackathon project. So essentially I had a shower thought today, earlier this morning, and what I was thinking about is like how uh, people could look at data and be able to go through different, like, uh, free response questions and be able to approach it. Like how would you even go through it without being overwhelmed? And one thing that I was inspired of is, um, it's uh, the works of Plato. Like I remember reading the allegory of the Cave last year or something. And I really liked how Socrates would talk a lot about like the philosophical nature of different, uh, topics. And then Glaucon, Plato's brother would listen along and then provide some interesting questions. So Socrates would answer as well. And I was thinking maybe this could be applied to the hackathon.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Prajwal's story arc here has gone from like rule following High schooler at the beginning of this project to last, uh, time. He was like, yo, he pretty much independently invented vibe coding in his own head. He's like, oh man, this vibe coding thing. I don't have to worry so much about the code. Just kind of like focus on the user experience. And I was like, yeah, we got our own little Andre Karpathy here in our, uh, in our midst or whatever. So, um, congratulations on that breakthrough and to see you submit this, this shower thought, this philosophical meandering, it must've been hard for you because dude, I went to his, uh, valedictorian ceremony at his high school. This guy's like a class, a superstar here, um, checking all the boxes. So to submit an unfinished project, it was a kind of a shower thought. It is probably on the edge of what you usually turn in for your own work.

**Prajwal:**
Thanks Kris Krüg. Uh, first of all, sorry for like blinking down in this video. Like I was recording this at midnight, like, and it's submitted, it's a half an hour late, uh, past the submission. But yeah, essentially this project was from like a shower thought that had in the morning, and then that evolved into like a coding sprint that I spent like four hours on and like, I was supposed to sleep, but like it was during midterm season too, so I really didn't have much time to work on it. But like, I like coding and like vibe coding in general, just like building these kinds of products. It's like kind of my, my jam and like, even though it feels like I'm sacrificing my time to like try to like build these projects, I really, really enjoy building them. And, uh, yeah. So yeah, so in these, uh, hackathons I've been part of, like, I really enjoyed like, uh, working through with this data and I'm really grateful to Rival Technologies and Kris Krüg for making it happen.

[Prajwal awarded $1,000 Hall of Fame bonus prize]

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Prajwal is currently unhirable. He's dealing with his immigration to Canada situation and going to Langara College. But there's a, a short but cool line of people that are trying to hire him. Um, you can connect with him directly. I'd be happy to put you in touch, but he's one of the smartest guys in our community and he is 18 years old.

## First Annual AI Film Festival

**[[Kevin Friel]] (Pixel Wizard / Prompt Goblin):**
Thanks Kris Krüg. Thanks everyone. I say this every month when I come up and, and speak about AI film, but it's a transformative time once again, and we thought, what better way to kind of showcase the, the rapid change often daily, sometimes multiple times a day, than to put a spotlight on our local, our national and our international friends and neighbors of, of creators, both new and experienced. Uh, and we're gonna kick it off, uh, with our first 15 minute AI film festival, which I'm really excited to, uh, talk about.

[Film Festival Screening - Multiple Short Films Including:]
- Horror short with practical AI effects
- Romantic comedy with leaf effects
- Farm/consciousness philosophical piece
- Lucid dreaming narrative
- D&D comedy "Critical Seduction: Darlings"
- Roach horror testimonial

### Panel Discussion: State of AI Filmmaking

**Bay Rate (Visual Effects Legend - Lord of the Rings, Valve, Pixar):**
For me, it's all about empowering the individual. I think that is absolutely the best way to move forward with this technology because it allows us, as the creatives, as the professionals to express ourselves very fully. Um, you're able to bring your vision to life, and I really hope that this technology can open the door for Canadian filmmakers to make bigger things and to be able to get their ideas out in a way that we just never have had the chance before.

One of the great advantages to me is to be able to explore almost any idea, any visual style that I want for very little money. 'cause there's, there's every, as you use any AI model, there's these boundaries between the, the, the gravity wells of the commonplace cliche and the unknown. And, and as you go into the unknown and you make a human contribution, you carry it from just being a cliche into being something unique and original and compelling.

I had a project that had sat on the shelf for 23 years. I think one of the great benefits of AI filmmaking is that ideas that have put aside for a really long time, I'm now able to drag those scripts out of the dust bin and see if I can get them going again.

**Ryan Patterson (Director - Grail, TIFF premiere):**
I think an opportunity for Canadians in this space is that we have a lot of people who are already in film and television. We have very creative people with unique perspectives, and I think that's super exciting. A quick story. I know a person who comes to our Toronto AI filmmaking meetups, and he submitted a short film, beautiful short film for a 48 hour film Fest, Runway film Fest. And he ended up in the top 10 or top 20 for his film. Where Did You Go To Earth School? Um, he said, he's like, I just like film. I love movies, I love stories. And so to me that's very impactful because what that tells me is that someone who is a storyteller and he is, he, maybe he wasn't sure if he even knew that, but it's going to give an opportunity for a lot more people to share their perspective.

**Elvis Dean (20-year veteran animator, Toronto):**
Well, I think if we can get to a place where the technology allows actors and directors and just artists that have traditionally worked on film can use this technology to be able to tell bigger stories or more in depth stories than they could before by just lowering the budgets or just giving them more scope. That's a huge opportunity for human creativity.

**N Ek (Lighthouse AI Workshops):**
I think people are starting to stand up way more and take leadership positions. Pioneer this technology. I will build a standard and precedent in my industry on how this should be used. Um, so I hope you join us. I hope you join the transformational and join the initiative. It'll be a beautiful world if people keep creating beautiful things.

**[[Michael Tippett]]:**
As a Canadian, and as lots of my friends and people I know, you know, they all, everyone has that unique perspective and there is such a beautiful diversity in Canada that I am confident that these tools are gonna empower people to be able to really share that unique perspective. And, you know, not just within Canada but worldwide.

### Live Panel: Luke (Animator) & Tim (VFX Compositor)

**Luke (20+ year animation veteran, director since 2001):**
Yeah. So, um, the animation I did was the, uh, the d and d one, critical Seduction Darlings. Um, and that character was definitely not based on my, uh, personal d and d character that I always play. Um, but, uh, we won't shame d and d bias and this is a safe space.

Um, so, uh, I actually, I knew I wanted to be an animator at 12 when I watched Jurassic Park in theaters. And, um, I got my first animation job at 17. I was directing by 21. That was in 2001. So I've been directing animation for a really long time. Um, had lots of experience over probably a lot of, a lot of shorts actually. And, um, more than a billion views now. So, um, just on a lot of, you know, Barbie and all that kinda stuff, I did way too much Barbie, honestly.

But, uh, but yeah, so, um, as I jumped on the AI train very, very quickly, early on, 'cause I just really saw the potential and I've always been, um, writing and, and wanting to get my own stories. I've, I've pitched so many broadcasters for my own shows and I've never gotten green lit. And, um, and now's the opportunity. And I, I've just, just recently, in the past few months, it's gotten to the point where you can actually produce studio quality production where you, you almost can't tell. There's still a few things, but you can almost not tell that it is, is AI. It just, it, it's a completely different process though. Um, so it's been really interesting to kind of play around with it. I, I love, so that, that, um, two minute animation that I did, I did that in three days from script to final edit, which is just unheard of.

**On costs and traditional workflows:**
I, I just for context, I, I worked on a, a Kraft dinner commercial - Cheese-asaurus Rex. I animated that guy with a big team of people. And, um, that one of those spots cost like, you know, between 200 to $400,000 depending on what, and a big team of people months of work for a 30-second spot. And I just did two minutes in three days by myself.

**On the quality and his process:**
I think I am maybe a little OCD as well, so that helps, uh, just like a really obsessive with making things perfect. And so a lot of the processes, it's a mix of AI. I'll bring stuff into Photoshop a lot as well. And, um, and I do hundreds of generations. I mean, I, I spend over a hundred dollars in credits on that, that shot on that two minute thing, and it's because I did so many generations until I got the right acting, the right performance. And even then, I'm not quite happy with a few of the shots because comedy timing is really everything, right?

**On iteration and happy accidents:**
I, I think one, one of the interesting things that I really love is the amount of iteration. Um, you can try so many different things so quickly and you, you also get some happy mistakes sometimes. And so it is, it, it's very different. It's a really big paradigm shift from traditional production. Um, it is a lot more like having a co-director that is really weird and just does like random shit and, um, but like, cool, weird, like sometimes cool, productive, weird. 90% of the time it's just unusable. But, um, you know, 10% of the time you get some real gold.

**Tim (VFX compositor, immersive technology specialist):**
In terms of comfy UI, like it's, it's more exploration at this point. There's like a lot of, like, as you mentioned, final pixel. It's, the things aren't really getting to final pixel yet, but in terms of like implementing Comfy UI and implementing AI, it's experimentation, right? You have people like you, you understand what you do, you understand animation, you understand how to make a good shot, comedic timing. Like that's what we need more of. We need people who understand what like they're bringing and how to get that out of the AI and do this.

**On VFX industry and AI:**
There's things in what we do, and that's kind of how I wanted to explore Comfy UI and VFX, and there's so many, I, I don't know if many of you understand like VFX and how shots are composited and how it's all built, but it's a super complex and there's so many layers, so much data coming in that to say that AI is gonna take over VFX, it's like, but like what part of it? There's like so many different things that go on. There's CG, there's like matching plates, there's color, there's, there's all this stuff. And like people get really scared that AI can do all this stuff. AI can do it. And it's like, well it's not, no, you gotta apply it on at the task you're trying to do. Right.

**On previsualization:**
Right now I find, especially with like, uh, I'm like immersive technology and kind of doing that stuff right now, it's like it's open, like working with like the cutting edge technology and all of that stuff right now. So we're kind of experimenting on how to get this stuff implemented in a way that's gonna be useful. And we're finding that pre-visualization is big. Like getting your idea out there and that, that's where it's becoming very fast.

**On new tools like Nano:**
Especially, so I, I've, I've made that short before any of this stuff came out, like nano or like, uh, yeah, like flex context. But now you have the ability to literally, like, I could make a first frame and then I can take my character and say, make them smirk, make them smile with big teeth, or like, turn their head to the right, turn their head to the left, like put their hand up in a gesture. And you're just, you're constantly able to like, manipulate this character now in, in the shot with like minimal degradation to like the data or to the image.

**Luke on collaborative AI filmmaking:**
I've actually been actively working on putting together a pipeline for working collaboratively with other artists. Um, because there are some, you know, bigger projects that we're pitching on some like, um, uh, some indigenous animation, uh, like a series and, and stuff like that, that we want to do. And one person can't do a series, one person can't do a movie. Um, but we, we were looking into this longer format and so working towards how that works because it's a completely different paradigm. You don't really need to board, you can jump right into an animatic with, with Nano Banana. And, um, uh, yeah, there, there's a lot of really different things and it's a bit of a wild west right now.

**On Tiny Go Studios training initiative:**
Another initiative, I have a lot of, uh, you know, friends in the animation industry. I can people on my last team, one's now a massage therapist, one's an executive assistant and one is working at Staples. They, they, it, it's a really hard industry right now. And so one of the things that Tiny Go Studios is going to be launching, I'm not sure yet when, but we're, we're still working on it, but we want to do a school where we're actually teaching people how to transfer those skills in animation to using them for AI. And we are actively building a studio that is gonna be ambitiously doing more than just shorts. Like we we're looking, like I said, to like actual series, um, that are gonna be on TV and, and movies.

### Audience Q&A on AI Film

**Question on bridging the gap for traditional film workers:**
How do we bridge that gap? How do we bring people into the fold so that we can harness this expertise that we've cultivated and capitalize on this what's almost there to be brilliant so that we can kind of be at the forefront of this coming wave?

**[[Kevin Friel]]:**
These two guys and myself, we all come from the professional visual effects animation background. And we were all, and still currently in some cases, in really big teams doing very specific jobs in the line and to pivot over to another job in that line was really, really hard, if not borderline impossible. What I see is those people that were cogs in the storytelling wheel are getting to have bigger ownership of stories now. I think there's a really amazing opportunity to take the existing part of the skill sets that and the experiences that we all have and convert into like vibrant, you know, multiple pegs of the economy with unbeatable IP.

**Question on ethical training and IP:**
I put an image I created with AI on my Facebook feed, and I got a lot of reactions. And one woman out of the states wrote "AI is all about theft and lying." When it comes to what you guys are doing, how much do you feel that what comes on the screen when you prompt the AI is actually taking someone else's work and becomes yours?

**[[Kevin Friel]]:**
That is the heart of the matter in so many ways. It really is. That is something that we are all wrestling with right now in very big and serious ways. The legacy of the models that are out there that are dominantly being used have hoovered everything off of the internet, off of art station, off of artists' looks and history and everything. And that is so hard to move through right now. And we confront ourselves, and I think you guys share the same values... it's a technology that has come so quickly and has been unveiled with the consequences not kept into consideration, but here we are and that paradigm has shifted.

What I am hopeful for is the proliferation of new ethically trained models. So consensually trained, that means that anyone that is in Moon Valley or Adobe Firefly - everyone has given consent in those models. We're getting there. But we have a legacy that is like, ugh, and we need to clean up. And I confront myself daily with that.

**[[Kris Krüg]] on training models:**
[[Philippe Pasquier]] at SFU SIAT - his whole jam is training small models on artists' work. I have trained photographic models on only portraits I've ever taken, and I'm able to generate now new faces based on this type of thing. I am not trying to dodge the question by saying the people that are here that I present to you are exploring alternative methods for dealing with this type of stuff. And this stuff matters to us a lot. It's something we confronted every day in our work.

Everything that is generated now is slurped up from all but my particular photos have been trained into models more than anybody else I know. There's a website you can go to called haveibeentrained.com, where you can look at your own work. I've got like 2000 photos in the NVIDIA facial recognition data set that is used in all sorts of activities. That is a foundational model. It is crazy.

**Audience member (VFX color science technician):**
I work in the film industry on the technical color side. I've been noticing that people - back in 2021, I had friends that were serving tables and then they became editors because there weren't enough people to cover all of the instances. Nevertheless, nowadays it's quite the opposite. Now, what I've been hearing for people asking what do I do nowadays to break into industry - I started getting into Curious Refuge. Kevin [Friel], you're amazing, fantastic as well. Just to be able to come from a technical standpoint where you're consistently looking at data and transitioning into a creative ideas just like you guys do. The resistance that it's supposed to happen - I think what I've been hearing is just share the word, try to make it simple. Try to, you know, there's a period of resistance, there's a period of going down with what used to be, but this is going fast. And the more we get used to it, if you feel comfortable, Comfy UI to me is like, oh my God, I have to learn Nuke again. Jesus Christ. But kudos to you guys. Spread the word.

**[[Kevin Friel]]:**
I would not be here without Curious Refuge. I took one of their courses in their early days. That's what really got my feet wet. And their community is inspiring our community here. This is the first of hopefully a monthly offshoot of AI film in particular, to create community, to have these conversations, to deep dive into all of the latest and greatest and bring creators together. Whether you're brand new or really experienced. We want everyone in the same melting pot and bouncing off of each other and raising everything. 'cause it's more important to do that than ever.

**Question from Susan (UBC Center for Migration Studies cultural facilitator):**
I work as a cultural facilitator with the UBC Center for Migration Studies, and this past year we used AI actually just ChatGPT to create a script from the storytelling of two indigenous elders. One of them was the hereditary chief of the Musqueam Village, where we are all gathering today, and we were actually able to reproduce the Musqueam village before forced displacement. And we screened the film here at the Museum of Vancouver upstairs. We produced the film like the Village, and we did the photogrammetry of the elders. We did their mocap. It was very fun. Now their grandchildren can make video games with them if they want.

Understanding that the ethics around AI don't necessarily account for cultural intellectual property - what are the steps that you suggest if you've worked with indigenous communities before to have more of a relational and reciprocal approach?

**Luke:**
One of the great things about AI that people aren't talking about, I think is the fact that because we can create these things for so much cheaper and because the gatekeepers have traditionally been white male, this is an opportunity to really highlight underrepresented voices in a way that was just impossible before. You could not get buy-in because there wasn't - oh, well, I'm afraid that my little white son is not gonna see himself in all these indigenous people over here. So this is something that's really important to us in our studio - uplifting marginalized voices, specifically especially queer voices and indigenous voices and BIPOC voices. And so that is something that we're really pushing forward. And as far as you can get enough control out of the AI to give your own story, to tell it the way you want to tell it. So it really comes down to involving indigenous storytellers, period. That's it.

**Audience member (Karu) on ethical models:**
There is no way to train ethically trained models. That's bullshit that everyone who owns data - Shutterstock, all these companies are going around saying, oh, hey, we got the ethically trained models. You know what they're doing? They're saying all the photographers that ever uploaded photos to our platform, we have the license. Go pound sand. These are ours now. We own. So that is not ethically trained fucking models. That's them saying we got you by the balls again.

I think we have to give up the idea of IP and trademark and all this other stuff to ever enter the true age of AI. If you're gonna try and attach to the micro remuneration idea, it is not gonna work. There is no latent space true connection. I just feel like that's not the place. I think we have to truly say this is the next step or another step in a different medium of filmmaking.

My question was gonna be like, how much of you guys - you keep saying I asked the model, I begged the model it generates. I don't feel that's true. I feel like most of it is like, here's the character control net, here's the lighting control net. I feel like that's what you guys are doing. 'cause the consistency that I'm seeing seems much beyond the begging the model.

**Kevin/Luke/Tim:**
It's a little bit of both. We are in that wobbly quantum theoretical space where both can be true right now. And we have to see what resolves. In terms of you can put in references and it's more, the models are just getting better at coherency. That is giving us consistency now from a prompt. A lot of my stuff I'm not using reference images for right now. It's pure just consistency of prompting. And Claude is really helping me with that. And the model just keeps that in context with whichever job that you're doing now. That's where the consistency is coming from.

## Community Announcements

**Surrey AI Update (Emar & [[Matthew Schwartzman]]):**
We co-host Surrey AI networking events. We host our events in Surrey 'cause it is a little far to come all the way from Maple Ridge to Vancouver. Come out to our event. Come talk to us. We have a secret discount code for those people that are here.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
In like two minutes, you're gonna see an opportunity to donate to the youth of our community, and that's what we're talking about right there. Prajwal, Ethos, Emar, [[Matthew Schwartzman]], man, they hold us up. Thank you guys. Thanks for representing out there in Surrey. I really respect what you're doing. Matthew, thank you for the walkthrough video today of the new venue, man. I approve, bro.

**Karu (ByteDance Product Manager, Tokyo):**
I'm Karu and I just wanna thank you Kris Krüg and the BC AI community, and I really am honored to be here. The reason why I chose this community is basically when I was brought to the United States, and I'm actually full Japanese, but I was brought to the states and seeing the atmosphere in the United States versus Canada, Canada is like a wonderful location that I have never been. And I found out, really this is really not a melting pot. It's like each individual cultures still exist. That's one of the key point that I kind of felt, and I love this country really. I do.

There were a lot of concerns about AI - good things about AI. When we started from internet, everybody started to use that. They did not have any constraints or doubt of using that. But I do think that everybody's just worried about their IP, personal information. The internet was the same thing. I am in a Chinese company, but it's a Singapore entity that I am located and working in. And then what happens is that everybody thinks about ByteDance, TikTok, right? But we actually been really secure on protecting the data that's not gonna be shared on our models, but the other models that exist right now, they actually, you have to disable it or else they're gonna just keep on learning the models in it.

Why I'm here today is that I will be able to help out whatever the things that you have concerns or the things that you want to do, because it's about controlling AI. It's not about using it, it's about if you have money, if you control your money, you'll definitely have a great life. If you lose control of your money, then you'll have a bad situation in your entire life. So that's one of the things I feel about AI - it's about you control it, then you will definitely have a successful situation in your life.

I do think about the IP stuff, but I do think that there's other community globally that I've been talking to, even the film industries and also like in each individual photos, all these kind of stuff, and I do think that those will might be protecting halfway, but some things that has to be released. And I see that already happening globally. So if I could be able to talk to everyone, I know everyone's here, but I will be open to talk about anything that you want about global, China, Japan, anything. I really gonna be participating a lot more and I love everyone here and especially Kris Krüg and all this people in this community.

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
We're gonna do some crazy video photo, generative hackathon stuff together in the short term with ByteDance.

**Education + AI (Maya Arnold):**
Who's been to one of these education plus AI events? These things that we're doing here tonight are fun, they're energizing, but the real work happens in small groups. And so we've got a few of them happening. This is one at Ethos Labs. We're doing an educators in AI third meetup very soon.

**Mind, AI and Consciousness (David speaking for Loki):**
Mind AI and Consciousness. We're a bunch of eclectic folks who like to talk about the human side of AI. In other words, what's it like to be conscious? We've been wrestling with these ideas for 2000 years and we have new tools in the form of computer AI to help us maybe probe or understand some of these phenomena. That's what this group does. We have a topic once a month. We read, we meet, we talk, and it's a great lot of fun.

**[[Kris Krüg]] on Mind AI Consciousness website:**
David built the BC AI website that a lot of you guys became members on and he's building this other Mind AI and Consciousness website that synchronizes our different group chats with deep discussion. He's building an AI agent that's trained on all these private group chats we've been having inside the Mind AI Consciousness group. And it's quite amazing because if you join the group lately, you could just be like, Hey, what are we talking about? What's going on? What is David thinking about? What's the consensus on these things? The URL is mac.bcai.ca

## BC AI Nonprofit & Closing

**[[Kris Krüg]]:**
Out of this whole community has sprung a nonprofit. Many of you guys are members of it. I'd like for the rest of you to join. If you like Matthew or Emar or the youthful thing we got going on here, we give scholarships all the time. People come here for free. They go to meetups for free. Hackathons we sponsored - Ubada, are you here? Ubada has won five hackathons in the last two months, including a couple that we've sent him to recently. He's fucking crushing the scene. He's getting flown to France because of the last hackathon win that we sent him to, to represent Canadian Oceans internationally.

Those of you who are not a part of this whole situation, to join up cost $240 for the year means you're a part of this community. There's a bunch of perks, I'll tell you about them another time, but really it's being a part of this whole vibe and crew. So thank you. There's donuts in the lobby. We've got like an hour left before we have to go.

Vancouver AI over and out. Thank you very much for being here guys.
