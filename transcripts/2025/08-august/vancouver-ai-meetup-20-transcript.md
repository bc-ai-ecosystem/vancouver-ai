# Vancouver AI Community Meetup #20 - Verbatim Transcript
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Location:** McMillan Space Centre (Planetarium), Vancouver  

---

Hey, what's up everybody? Welcome to the Vancouver AI Community Meetup Number 20. You are the Vancouver AI community.  Thanks for coming out tonight. We got a lot of folks in town from other places. My parents are here from California.  Our keynote speaker, Jos Duncan is there from Philadelphia. Her and I worked together at, uh, a Google AI lab for journalists.

We're co-leading a lab that we're about, uh, five months into eight months through. I'm so happy you could be here with us tonight and, and share your word. She runs an organization called Love Now Media and affiliate is using AI and very progressive ways for social justice and education and community building and all that are, tell more about that.

We got Peter Bittner here, my bus, my business partner from the upgrade.ai. So  there's a thread that goes through all this. When I first moved back to Vancouver two years ago, I applied for a Google accelerator and I got in and I  came up with a lot of the ideas and worked through a lot of the business plans that have resulted in the upgrade AI and our, and my, these events that we're doing and stuff.

And, and so Peter and I worked alongside each other for a while and then we merged our companies together. So now we're co-owners in the upgrade.ai. I applied for another Google lab when they started doing this AI stuff, and they turned me down. Because they said you're the person that keeps coming up who we want to coach it.

So I got to coach it. And Joss is the other co collab lead. It's so cool. We all get to be be here together tonight. Uh, a lot of you guys know we, we've been running a hackathon with Rival a data storytelling hackathon. We're in round three. We've given away five Gs already. We're gonna give away another $2,500 tonight plus a special bonus prize.

'cause it was, um,  yo the projects,  they're nuts. They're nuts. Uh, the winner and the special project is like,  there's something special about each of 'em. All of 'em, all of 'em. There's a, it was very hard to choose and we'll talk more about that later. Um, then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the BC AI Nonprofit Society that we built and that we're launching here tonight.

This is a nonprofit dedicated to AI adoption and learning and all sorts of sectors in the creative industries and education and government. And so it represents the container to hold all the cool things, the sub events. You guys have been running the hackathons, we've been doing all, all the interesting stuff.

So I'll tell you a little bit more about that.  But first, uh, to welcome us here tonight, we got a couple special guests. Gabriel George, you might know is gonna, um, kick us off first. And then [[Carol Anne Hilton]] from the Indi Genomics Institute is gonna say a few words as well. So  yes, one, yes. Wanda. Yes, Wanda. 

Okay. Okay.  Come on up.  Come on up. One sec. Gabe, you come too. But my mom, I gotta introduce my mom real quick.  And my dad. And my dad. Of course. Look, you guys come as a pair. So I just figured if I said mom, that meant both. Uh, this is Debbie Krug, my mom. She was a lifetime educator. My dad, he's a agricultural economist with the state of California. 

Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming. I was gonna let you say something earlier, but if you keep it very, very short, you can say it right now. Okay?  Yay.  We are just so happy to be here and so proud of you, Kris Krüg, for summary. We came yesterday and for some reason, whenever we cross the border, we get very intimidated and we say the dumbest things and we rehearse.

One time Kelly even said, we're coming for pleasure, and he,  and I'm like, what in the world are you talking about  talking? But yesterday, the border,  yesterday, the border agent was very, he was very stern and he asked why we were coming and we said, we're, we're coming to hear our son speak at a conference. And he said, where? And we said, at the space center.

And he said, I've never heard of the space center. And I said, it's. The McMillan Space Center and he said, mm, haven't heard of it. And so he said, you know what, I think you mean the planetarium. And I'm like, that's it, the planetarium. And he said, I came here as a fourth grader and I have never forgot it. He said, this is the coolest place.

So we're so happy to be here. And thank you very much. You Kris Krüg, you're surrounded with wonderful people. We're blown away. I did ask one dumb question tonight, I said, is, is AI the same as chat GPT?  It's not a young question and I don't know the answer that guy told me. 

Thank you. 

This is our one year anniversary in this building and we're just signed the deal for round two, so we'll be back.  Gabriel's up next. 

It's,  I wanna welcome all of you here to this village that's known as ak. My, uh, let me,  my great great grandmother lived here in this village and they brought a barge in and they moved our families out of here. I hail from the TLE Tooth Nation and in the language I was giving thanks to our Musqueam ancestors  who share this territory to our Squamish ancestors and to my to my own as well.

And not only am I just registered under the Crown, under Colonial Laws, we have to register  like in one part of our family, but I come,  branches of my family go into Musqueam, go into Squamish, into many other places. It's a colonial construct to use a surname to attach ourselves through, through one line that we see things more as a web. 

And that's the way that our,  um,  we call in our,  our, our indigenous way of understanding things. That's the way that some of the elders that I've been blessed to work with, they see these, the, the internet, they see computers, they see it as something our people saw coming,  and they said that one day our world would be connected by a web, and through that we would be able to speak to each other.

These were prophecies that were preached prior to, to colonization,  prior to the first ships.  These waters that were on Broad Inlet, the first ship didn't come in here until the early 1790s, so that's almost 300 years after Columbus. That's a long time  before we saw the first European ship,  and my family has suffered a lot.

In that short time, our language was stripped away within two generations completely. And that's the story of many of our nations in the, all of the Pacific Northwest and in many corners of, of the globe under colonization  and the residential schools. At one point in British Columbia, it was illegal for us to wear our regalia.

I'm wearing a small part of regalia that I, I possess tonight, and to sing our songs, to speak our languages. If we were gathered in a group of this size, we would be arrested and thrown in jail under the Potlatch Laws in British Columbia.  And so my family, we've suffered a lot,  but through that suffering, we hung on to our ways of being.

We call it our suen off. We all in our old people's way of thinking, our Seth, our teachings,  and we've hung onto that.  And it's important in our culture, and it's important as human beings, regardless of where we come from, to have connection and healthy connection is important.  And so I look at what my ancestors went through, what happened in my family. 

This is not just stories from a headline or from a history book. It's something that I experienced growing up. And despite all of that, the integrity and the love that they carried forward, the elders in my family and the elders from the other nations around here, I grew up close with them as well. They were the same way. 

And so when we do this work in ai, it's good to have integrity, to have values.  What is the base that you're operating from and in that remember that connection is important,  that our people see it as a web. And it's interesting, that concept of the web, because that also comes from some of our origin stories.

The spider brought gifts down to some of our, our peoples, some of our first peoples in these, in these lands.  And so  I want to sing a song tonight. This song is a older song in my family. It's an eagle song. And when my, my late father was a young boy, like four or five years old, he was really taken by the drums.

And you know, one time he went missing at a festival. They couldn't find him at a canoe festival. And they, they found him over listening to some of our relatives in Lummi, that's in Washington state, just across the line. They were dancing there. They were attending a canoe festival. But he was off where the drumming and singing was.

So his grandmother, she  amist, 

she gifted, she gave my dad a, um, eagle song and she gifted him an eagle bonnet as well. It had feathers on it. And she beat him some, um, eagle, eagle appliques as well.  And my, my late father said that anytime  we see an eagle, he would stop and he would say a prayer. He would give thanks. He would, he told us that the, the eagle would bring our prayers to the,  she went off to the ancestors, to,  to the creator.

And so as I sing this prayer, I just this, this song to the puck, us who's flown over these lands. Since time outta mind, I just ask you to set good intentions for yourself and those that are in your circle.

O.

Thank you, Gabriel George, you bless us. Thank  you. Up next is someone who has taught me a lot about, uh, a lot of things, including the importance of opening gatherings like this in ceremony, in that way to kind of bring our attentions together and bring our energy together. So Carol Ann, I wanted to invite you to come up next and say whatever you would like. 

Carol Ann starts every meeting at our organization by asking the question, how are you showing up? And it means so much to me. I, I bring it into all my meetings and stuff as well. So how are you showing up tonight, Carolyn?  

Pretty excited. Thank you.  Thank you so much. Thank you Gabriel, for the beautiful opening, um, and reminding us to ground in place, into ground in teachings.

And I really want to ask this question.  What are we responding to  when you know that, when you know why you're here, when you know what has been brought together,  we have to know what we're responding to in this moment.  And when we do that and we can be real with what that answer is, then we can relate to each other and we can bring the best out of humanity itself.

And I think that this power moment is able to reflect that. I, I heard this quote and it said something to the effect, and you know, it's a little, it's a little fucked up out there right now, 

but I heard this quote and it, you know, we, we hear that Chinese version of that, of, you know, the, um, symbol of chaos. But the concept was that when we experienced chaos to create, and that's very much my focus, is that creative place inside of us, um, to make sense. And I was fighting with my Chachi PT the other night, like we was full on, full on.

And I took it right out to the edge of meaning.  I thought about it, the edge of meaning. Ooh, that's far out.  But that is this moment because as much as meaning has been prescribed to us and each one of our heritage and legacies of how we got here, there was a prescription of meaning applied onto our humanity, indigenous or not. 

And it's in that prescription of knowing what we're responding to and the freedom that we can create from. And that's why I have mad respect for my friend Kris Krüg. I'm so honored that you spent the time with Indi Genomics. Where's Mama Krug  did this? Did this kid come out that cool? Look,  seriously,  did he come?

He came. All that smart.  Amazing, big respect. Thank you for bringing everyone together in a beautiful, creative, powerful way. 

I can tell we're gonna run long. So I'm gonna sample little bits out of the keynote. I'm probably gonna have to cancel again to let you know that [[Carol Ann Hilton]] is one of the board members of the newly found BCAI Ecosystem Industry Association, this nonprofit that's bringing us all together. Thank you for carolann for trusting me, and I'm excited to be in this canoe with you.

So here we go. All right. Up next, we got, as I said, [[Jos Duncan Asé]] from Philadelphia, who I work with through the Blue Engine Collaborative Program for the Google News Initiative. We're, uh, we're teaching a bunch of journalists about AI and we're helping them with their projects and stuff, but, um, that's how we've gotten to know each other and made a strong connection.

But Joss, I really respect as an activist and as a leader in her community, uh, media personality. Come on up here, Joss. 

She flew here from Philadelphia to come to this and so we can meet. I'm so happy. Thank you. Joa really blessed me.  

Thank you so much for having me. Hello everyone. Wow, this room looks so amazing. Um, I'm actually gonna share something with you guys.  

One second. 

Okay. I'm actually gonna share something with you guys. Um, that's a bit personal and I didn't expect to share it, but I feel like this is a space where I can kind of give you what's real for me. I lost a loved one last week and I actually have to head out tonight, uh, for a funeral tomorrow. But I have learned to navigate grief and loss by celebrating life. 

Thank you. 

So it was important for me to be here because I get to live  and I get to feel and I get to connect with all of you, right? That's life.  And so I wanna ask all of you to take a journey with me.  I want you to think about the last time you witnessed an act of love.  Just think about it.  Maybe just close your eyes for a moment.

If you feel comfortable.  When was the last time you witnessed an act of love?  Now, whatever that feeling is, just hold that feeling here with you for a moment.  Now I'm gonna ask you to think about one more thing. When was the first time you witnessed an act of love?  Maybe inhale and exhale. 'cause some of this has taken you back to that small little child. 

Just think about it the first time. 

Now, what is that feeling?  Take that feeling  and just hold it with you for a moment, because I'm gonna ask you to recall it at a point. Okay?  So in my work, ideal in love, um, okay. Can we get the slideshow now? Thank you.  So well, we're, we're gonna talk about love and ai.  Uh, if you didn't know we were talking about AI tonight,  but also love, um, in my work, I, I deal a lot with love.

I tell love stories. I'm a media person. I'm usually talking about media. Um, how many of you here are media professionals? Can I just see your hand? If you work in media? Okay. And how many of you work in tech? Some kind of tech. Woo. Okay. So it feels like I'm finding my people right, but you guys really kind of aren't my people.

Like my people are really media people, so I kind of feel like I'm cheating on my first love, but that's okay.  Um, the thing about it is, uh, in my work, I do a lot of work for social justice, for equity, for abundance, and for joy. And a lot of that is through reporting on black, indigenous and brown communities through this lens of love.

Because especially where I'm from in Philadelphia, uh, most of the stories about black brown people are usually about crime, harm, all of that. So my, my platform has been love now media, but in 2022.  When I was introduced to chat, GPT and Midjourney, which I was able to create my nails and uh, some collard greens with,  um, I fell in love with this, what this could do and what the potential was.

And so I dove to feet deep into the world of ai and I thought I was doing this fantastic thing because I could fill this gap between the tech working class and the tactile working class. So the tech working class people like most of you who have access to the new tools that are developing, who understand what's happening, but then there are also the people who are very hands-on in their jobs, the mechanics, the, the people who are not interacting with technology at all.

I felt like I, and all of my identities could be a representative to fill those gaps. So I was very excited about my work in ai.  Can we go to the next slide?  And my community was not. Next slide.  They felt betrayed. How could you get into this thing, this robotic thing, this awful thing? How could you use AI to create a social media calendar?

Ah, how could you generate an image of a child with ai? It was, it was as if I was doing something awful. And so what I realized early on is that in media.  Um, we can go back one slide,  Kris Krüg. I think we have to get the clicker thing next time.  Um, I realized that I had to disclose how I was using AI because people started to distrust this lovely media I was creating.

And so I decided to create an AI ethics policy. And with that policy,  I was able to let people know what I was doing with ai, why I was doing it, and how it supported our mission. So I think this act of transparency really helped people to feel safe. No, I am not using AI to do reporting, but I am using it to create those social media calendars.

I am using it to help to write some proposals and to do things like that. But also what was most important is in this AI policy, I put that it was important for us to be using AI because black communities were so often left behind in the ai. Game or in the technology game. And so when I put that out there, people began to say, oh, well maybe we should do a policy.

And so that's how I got into training people on how to do AI policies that had mission aligned values. And so that went really well for a while until  I  started creating some tools and doing some fun stuff in my personal life. And then I took a negotiations class. And this, this class had nothing to do with ai, but in this negotiations class, I learned something new about myself.

The class was very competitive. Now, yes, I'm a loving person and I like deep breathing and meditation and all of that. But when this professor said that there was like a prize for everyone who won the negotiation, something else came up in me, right?  And so I started winning these negotiations and not by a little bit, I was winning by like tens of thousands of dollars more than all of the other students in the class.

And I thought I was just a great negotiator until one of the people I negotiated against came out mad. And she said, I don't trust her.  And I'm like, me?  How could that be possible? I'm like the most trustworthy person there is, you know?  And so the professor started to break down, uh, different types of negotiation personalities.

There's the purest who is transparent and ethical at all costs. There's the pragmatic, who is not necessarily trying to be malicious, but will hide their hand if they need to. And then there's the opportunist who will lie to your face  in order to win that negotiation. Now, it wasn't quite an opportunist, but I was not a purist, which I thought I was.

I was actually a pragmatist. And so this was very funny because, um, it was important for me to know this about myself personally. Now I do business kind of as a purist, but in my personal life I'm a pragmatist, you know? And so will I train AI on someone else's work? Not exactly, but will I train it on a summary?

Nah, I just might, you know, it depends. It depends. And so these are the kinds of questions  it seemed important to, to urge people to think about. What will you do?  What will you do if faced with the opportunity to make money from someone else's work? What will you do if faced with an opportunity to create a policy that makes you have to, to, to pay into some equitable thing that you may not wanna pay, but you know it's the right thing to do?

What are your personal values?  And so I started to encourage folks to create personal ethics policies so that you know how you're entering this AI space. We just had a talk about values, right? What are your values? They might be different from your company's values. And so it's important to know that. 

And so  this all went really well, and we can go to the next slide.  And I was telling people how important it was to really think about what they were doing, how they were interacting with ai, how they were responsible, how they should be accountable. And I realized the, the billion dollar companies behind ai.

We're not always thinking about that. I, I was seeing news articles about companies and, and legislation being passed that allowed these companies to use other people's intellectual property with no payment.  I'm seeing articles day after day about the environmental harms that are being caused by ai.

It's harming communities, harming land, uh, using water, harming the environment, uh, using up some of the, the, the natural, uh, elements of the earth.  This is not something that the users  should be responsible for. It actually reminded me of this incident we had in Philadelphia, and this is very awkward because I am in another country about to say something slightly bad about Philly.

I love Philadelphia.  I love Philadelphia.  But at one point, people were, uh, there was a, a thing where people were being urged to recycle and we would receive fees if we didn't separate the recycles properly from the, the trash, right? So people were getting these hefty fees between like $50 and $300, and it was a big deal because it was, it was an aggressive action.

So it was a whole big thing.  But the trash was being taken to a little city called Chester, Southwest of Philadelphia, and being burned in an incinerator.  They weren't being fined for that,  but they were causing so much harm in Chester, pa. Like how, how does that happen? Right? So I started to think about this  in the AI space because people started to see me as an AI evangelist.

So I'm coaching for Google News Initiative, which is amazing. I love it. Um, I'm speaking about the capabilities of AI and how much we can do with it, but I know that there are real harms. Real work is being stolen. Real people are, are like being put out of work because they don't have access to any equity or, uh, their livelihoods have been pretty much swept up by ai.

Environmental harms are happening and there are so many exploitative practices happening.  This is beyond the users' responsibility.  So this is when it occurred to me  that I need to not only celebrate the capabilities of ai, but I need to advocate, I need to use my social justice mind, right? To really think about what is it like to organize and what is it like to  onboard people to the next slide,  to something meaningful in the AI space.

So I am now gathering people and, and talking to people about this AI advocacy initiative. Yeah. 

Thank you. So through this initiative, I wanna give people information and education about ai because we need it, right? We're at the point now where you don't even have to be into AI to be using ai, right? It's, it's literally everywhere. So I want people to understand, to have spaces, to have conversations, and ask questions about ai, but I also want to make collective demands that benefit humanity. 

Okay? I want to call out those who are causing harm and demand corrective action.  And I want to uplift those that are doing good work. Right. That's what this space is all about. I was watching the old, uh, talks from Vancouver ai and there was a guy last month, I believe his name was Lionel. Is it Lion?

Yeah. Is he here? He's not here. You called in sick like 15 minutes beforehand.  He's been on, he's been on mu tech all week sharing his new energy calculator for ai. Amazing. Amazing. So I wanted to call his name Lionel. What's his last name? Lionelle Ring. Let's, let's give it up for Lionelle because that's amazing work. 

I also want to call out Anthonia and the Ethos Lab.  Anthonia is here for sure. Amazing work teaching young people to innovate, to, to world build, to teach techno. We should be uplifting the people who are doing things right, right. But also making sure that we collectively demand  things that to, to reduce the harms of ai.

Next slide, please.  So these are some of the things that, you know, we're like posting, like we, we give factual information. Again, I'm a media person, right? So I gotta tell a story. So this is what is happening and this is what we're advocating for. This is what is happening and this is what we're advocating for.

Like, let's just make it plain. But how can we get these kinds of images flooding on social media? How can we do like digital protests, digital, digital, like, um, direct actions. Like how can we think about some of the, the tactics and strategies that we've used to demand justice in other spaces? How can we do that in the digital space?

So this is what I'm working on. And, um, yeah,  next slide.  So 

I, I wanted to reflect on a conversation. I was actually at dinner with Kris Krüg and Anthonia last night, and Anthonia asked Kris Krüg, she said, why do you do the work you do? And Kris Krüg said,  I'm actually trying to build a future I wanna live in. Was that it? Yes.  And I thought that was like incredible, right? So I feel like if we think about loving the code, remember that love feeling you guys held onto? 

What does that feel like? Just take a moment.  What does that feel like to put love in the code? 

What does it feel like to put love in the policies? Not to just write something random and chat GPT and throw it on your website, but what does it feel like to have people feel that you are really connected to them, that you really care about their journey here, right? Like, we get to live together,  love in the land,  we get to share a physical space. 

What does that feel like to put that wherever we go  and loving the culture? This is a loving culture. Kris Krüg, you got something good going on here? I, y'all are amazing. 

So with that, those are the things that I am advocating for because one day AI will be smarter than us  and when that time comes,  I wanted to love us enough to save us.  And that's my talk. 

Don't run away. I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you this one for a second. Okay. Is that what you got? Another mic for me? 

Should I give the sketchy one here or run with the sketchy run with the sketchy.  

Wow Josh, that's amazing. You know, sometimes I wonder like how our roads kind of like lead Exactly. Here. And then when you talk right now, please come out here into the light. I'm sweating profusely. It's actually quite embarrassing, but you can hide over there if you No, it's okay.

Um, but when you talk, I realize it's 'cause like we're values and heart align. Yeah. And you saw the bat signal we were putting out here. Leonal and us and this whole community and, and we connected for real. And thank you for bringing that message here. I mean, when I describe our community to other people in the wide world, I'm like, we're stoked about all these opportunities and possibilities and we are, have concerns and questions over here and we're walking forward both those things in our hands at the same time.

Mm-hmm And that's what you're talking about. You're like, yeah, it unlocks all this stuff for me, but also I demand it to be held to account in these ways. And that's amazing. That's like such a good way of talking about how I feel too. So thank you. Thank you so much for sharing that. Alright, thank you.

Let's get some question answers going. Who wants to talk to Joss?  Any feedback? All right. There we go. Kush. Uh oh.  So hey, tonight what the theme was, eat life short, eat the dessert first. So we started with the best keynote, then we're going to the next best keynote. Then we're going to the community.  That's a lot of pressure.

Sorry. Came from the farthest Peter, then came from the second farthest. That's good. That's good. But anyway, um, usually Kush asks tough questions at the end, but tonight I guess we're gonna be asking tough questions at the beginning.  

So I just do what I want, but Kris Krüg always frames it like it's very intentional.

Like  I, there are not, not that many brain cells in, in this, uh, body. Um, I, I so appreciate your talk. I appreciate the work you're doing and especially the work around justice and, and seeing things through a lens of what's fair and what's right. Um, so that's all good. And I could just go on about all the beautiful things that you've said.

Uh, but my question and sort of one thing that I wanted to push back against is in this two slides that you talked about, the diagram or the, sorry, the, the graphics. One thing that I immediately noticed is like a sort of, you know, like when you have a filter in your brain, you're looking up at a thing, it just kind of sparks out to you, is you had.

Uh, copyright issues for this and that. And you mentioned stable diffusion, right? Mm. And, and this has been going on for two years, and to me it immediately is like a, like a slight against me and other others because this has been the framing that has been used by the industry. Mm. Mid journey, uh, by Dolly, right.

Tools that are commercial, proprietary and are actually stealing, quote unquote art, you know, stealing artists work and they, you know, they will always target stable division in that kind of a frame. Mm-hmm. But, but stable division is the open source, uh, one, it's the alternative. The first one actually on the scene that are the balls in Marma stock in UK to publish it and, you know, double, you know, whatever happens.

So that is the one that actually allowed Prince and everyone else around here to create their own artworks, uh, over on top of their labor of every, all the other artists while not pretending like they grew it like they were happy to admit it's ai. Not that many AI artists actually don't wanna admit it's ai.

They're happy to have that thing. So my view, my question is like,  first of all, can we always make sure that there are IRS against the ones that are actually profiting off this stable, efficient, doesn't make any money, right? It's open sourced the open internet, the open source. And also how do we truly do the compensation for artists and all of this?

'cause I think if you have New York Times suing OpenAI and we set a precedence that training means you compensate the trainers, sorry, you compensate the data, uh, from the trainee trainers. That means only the people who have the kind of money, uh, to pay those, uh, entities will ever be the ones to be able to train models and they will never open source it.

So we will continue to live in a world that proprietary now becomes a standard and open source will completely die. 'cause there will never be any incentive to open source a model if you have to pay a trillion dollars to all people involved. 

Uh, and 

I think open internet, open knowledge. Knowledge.

You know, I, I don't believe in copyright patents and trademark. There's a whole different thing. So, so what do you, so yeah, what do you think? So, 

yeah, so my answer to that is, is actually that we need spaces like this to have these kinds of conversations, right? I don't come to you as someone who knows everything that you do about tech.

Remember, I'm the media person, but you and I now have a connection. Where I can go and adjust my slide so that it more accurately represents what we should be advocating for. And I think we also could include, say a lawyer in our conversation, any lawyers in the house,  you know, and so this is where we can start to co-design what this advocacy looks like.

And so that would be my answer. I think there's always room to learn to grow, to incorporate feedback, right? And so thank you for your feedback. 

Yeah. And I always re reserve the right to go editorial on these stuff a little bit too, you know? And the first question was like, yo, why you gotta punch down on open source software like stable diffusion when you could punch up on all these people who are profiting?

And that's valid. And I think that's great. Like that. That makes a lot of sense. Um, the other thing you said was, uh, how, how do you do the information provenance that allows you to pay creators on who's, and man, that one's fucked. I think that ship is sailed. I'm not sure. I'm not really sure, bro. It's a 

really good question.

But, you know, but, but there are things like people are putting, like journalism on the blockchain. Like there has to be a way to put, you know, like IPS on the blockchain. Where's Melinda? You know? Yeah. So just 

don't, don't pump your company, but just. Talk about art on the blockchain? 

Yeah. Yeah, a hundred percent.

So I'm a recovering journalist, X-X-X-P-B-C London Times Wow. A b, C news a lot. And, but also a technologist working in ai. I've been working in AI since 2011. One of the things that I've come to the conclusion was within, in my current company is the blockchain actually has a tremendous capability when combined with ai, right?

To be able to, just to what Kris Krüg said about the provenance of who owns what for attribution, right now, anybody say in the podcast, but anyone could take a whole collection of podcasts and just create a digest of those, and those, those podcasters would be left behind. But what if all of that information was tokenized, right?

So you know exactly who to attribute, who created what, and you have an immutable record of it, and then that opens up the opportunity to monetize. So that's the kind of thing that I'm working on and I, 

I would love to work with you. I mean, this is 

this, this connection between I, her company's technology pretty well, and there's a really strong connection.

Yeah. But thank you very much for what you're doing. I mean, I totally agree. We all need AI ethics pol like, and, and self-awareness and consciousness about it and mm-hmm. Being able to infuse it with the, the right intentions. Yeah. 

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I got at least one more.  

Hi, my name's Tara Robertson.

I love to, I'm Tara.  

Hi. I met Tara at the reception. She's introducing herself. Um, I think values are super important and I heard that that's true for you too. Can you tell us a couple of your values and give us some examples of how that shows up in the work that you do? 

Yeah, thank you so much for that question.

Um, actually,  we've been reporting under four on four beats, and those are social justice, wellness, abundance, and joy.  And our reporting framework is about connections to community, to lineage, to land, and to the future. So it's very Afro indigenous, um, the framework, our reporting framework. And so those are my, those are some of my values.

I mean, those are some of my community's values. And we were able to identify a framework to help us make sure that all the stories we tell are not just about these things that are happening in communities to people, but we want them to feel like they are also connected. When you're reading a Love Now Media story, you can see those connections to community, to a, a lineage, to a space or place, or like a land.

And then there's some outlook for the future. And so that's how it shows up in my work.  

Thanks Jo. Um, Nick, I'm sorry. I got one more over here and then we probably got to change channels.  Um,  I now's a, a quick chance to connect on your phones with Love Now Media. You might just wanna check it out before she goes away.

Oh, there was a, because she's about to go poof, she has to leave, as she said, because of that family situation. So she's gonna have to leave in a minute. Yeah. So let's, let's connect with there. We got one more question. I also wanted to say, if you make it to her website, which you should click on the About section and then read the two thirds of the way down there is her AI policy.

No, no, that's the wrong, uh, this is the personal website, but you can go to Love Now Media. Go to Love Now Media. 

Click on about Go three paragraphs down. It's her AI policy. It's the best fucking AI policy I've ever read in my life. It changed me profoundly. I've been teaching it every single time I get a chance to, since I read it and I maybe I've taught it in some of your guys companies.

Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, you should remix it however you like. It's profound and progressive and awesome and I love it. Thank you Jo, for sharing that with us. Thank you so much. Alright, last question here.  

Hi Jos. Uh, my name is Maurice Earl. Um, and I think again, what you said, it really connected with me on many ways, not only, and it's not really a question I have, but I just wanna say you're, you're, you're doing good.

Some good stuff here. Um, I'm feeling inspired here because I'm not only within the AI side, I'm also within the, uh, the, the black community side. And a lot of these things can be applied to towards like, uh, uh, nonprofits and, and, uh, you know, the connection of. Not only the, the community, but also with the journalism side.

Um, because I'm actually in talks with global BC and such as well, and like even making it interesting of bringing people from different communities to the journalism side, which is,  I think it's getting a little bit of a hit, but I think stuff like this is what's going to, you know, really bring people into it.

So I, I, I just appreciate you. Um, I know you have to go, but I'm gonna talk to Antonio 'cause I'm actually, uh, a board member and I, I wanted, I wanted to, uh, I'm gonna get, yeah.  Um, I'm everywhere and nowhere. Um, but I, I do want to get your information. I do wanna get in contact with you. Very much so. Thank you so much. 

I'm Matt Maurice at Sury ai, one of our subgroup things that sprung up out in the suburbs and that's, that's too cool. I didn't know you all were connected. Josh, thank you. Thank you. I love you. Thank you everyone. 

Jos Duncan  Za.  

Thank you so much. Thank you. That was amazing. 

Damn. We're off to a strong start. Um, Peter Bittner is up next. As I told you, I met this guy at that Google Accelerate I went to in 2023. We were the only two guys out of a cohort of 20 companies doing AI stuff. And, um, we thought that was hilarious.

Uh, a lot of them were starting businesses that are probably now in, um.  Industries that won't be going forward to the future, which is,  and for me it was close. I thought I was gonna be starting, uh, like a content type company. I didn't realize it was community. That was the only path forward. I almost started a content company and  that would've been a mistake, um, as the value of content continues to cruise towards zero.

Okay. Peter Benner up here to talk about the future of work.  

Woo.  Work. Yeah. Love that. I have to go after that. Oh my god, Josh, you set me up for failure over here. Um, fantastic. Yeah, remarks. Really want to, uh, congratulate her on just leaving it all out there. And I think that's a great way to set, you know, the intention in the space here as well.

Further for some of the hard conversations and some of the messy ones, frankly, that, you know, we're all navigating together. Um, I'm ready to go wherever. I'm gonna try this remote thing and see where we are. Um, so I'm gonna try to at least open a conversation here to think about where we're headed with the job market, right?

What it means for us, our organizations, our families, um, what's lacking, what happens, uh, if we do nothing, what happens? If we embrace it, and what are the opportunities here that we might be missing? Um, well first of all, you know, isn't AI just a hype bubble, guys? Um, you guys all saw GPT five. It sucked, right?

Woo. Um, does anyone here love chat? GPT five, the same way they love four? Okay, I see one hand.  Anyone else? It's okay if you do, guys, it's fine. We're gonna get used to the new model. It is more advanced in many ways, but sure not the order of magnitude leap forward that we were promised, right? And that many of us anticipated here.

Um, but not the end of the world either. Um, I think we're probably not in a crash cycle, but we've seen some other headlines recently, many of us probably right, about AI projects and initiatives in the workplace, uh, from, you know, well reputable organizations, uh, that have said, you know, these projects aren't going anywhere, right?

They're a waste of money. There's no financial impact. But guess what guys? We are still in the first inning, I'll use, uh, a baseball analogy. We're in the very, very beginning of this all. And so one of the biggest reasons why a lot of you know, disappointment about these new models, as well as some of the poor performance really comes down to one key thing, which is humans, right?

And change management and organizational. You know, upskilling, and this is what we're gonna talk about a bit today. And so I love to include this in a lot of the classes that Kris Krüg and I teach together. But this is a quote from a futurist Ro Mara, and it's often attributed to Bill Gates. Bill Gates loves this quote, he loves to steal it.

Um, but we tend to overestimate the effect of tech in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. So this is kind of a nice reminder. I almost include this in every presentation, just to remind myself, right, to try to get out of that hype mentality or, you know, it's easy, right? With these ups and downs, they're almost emotional for those of us many in this room, right?

Who pay so close attention here. Um, and even those who don't, frankly, the headlines are enough to, you know, give you a lot of whiplash here emotionally about where we are and where we're headed in all this. But regardless of, you know, where GPT 5.1 or whatever the next model is from whatever company, open source or not, right?

The key thing here to realize is that it's gonna take us a while as a workplace culture, as a society to catch up to what's already here, right? That's one of the cool things about this community and why I am so excited to be here, is that you all are really grappling with this, right? In real time together and asking the hard questions.

But even if there's no improved models, then. Whatever. Today is the 26th of August. Is it still the 26th? It's been a long day. Came up from Seattle. Um, then guess what? We've still got a lot to grapple with. And the way that we work, the way that we communicate with one another, um, and get things done is already forever changed.

We just probably don't know it yet. Right? The another quote that I love to remind my students and myself is, you know, the future is here, is just unevenly distributed. That is the moment we are in right now, right? That is where we are today. And for those of us who, you know, are really playing around in, in the deep end and sometimes going off of it, right?

Um,  it's something that I think we are able to also slowly feel like  more and more we're just getting started with this, right? This is the 20th, Kris Krüg. Is this the 20th meetup? That's insane how early you guys are to all of this. Um, and how each of you're building up your AI literacy, your capacity, your fluency, right?

And all this terminology, all the ethics and all of the, you know, other sort of really messy issues, frankly. But we're in the beginning of a platform shift, right? We're maybe coming down from the crest of the first wave of ai, right? It is something that's gonna transform the economy, generative ai, and whatever comes next over the next few decades, right?

This is something of a Pandora's box, right? We don't necessarily have the ability. You know, or politically we're not willing to push back and revert to a pre generative AI world, right? That is the unfortunate truth. We in many ways, right? It's also  a double-edged sword. It also gives us some superpowers, right?

Organizationally, personally. Um, and we've seen a lot of these, right projections probably about where things could go.  We've seen some things from IMF, McKinsey, you know, GDP growth by 7% in the US and Canada. That's insane. That's wild in, you know, emerging economies that are AI native, for example, China or others, you know, that could be triple.

And so these are some of the projections out there from very well regarded, again, um, international organizations and firms, right? Um, McKinsey, and I think this is probably an underestimate, right, of some of the trillions of, you know, increased economic activity that will come. But we are at a moment here where we're having, you know, sort of the introduction of electricity again, right?

Um, and what does that mean for us, right?  I have been in, you know, training here for a few years and when we first started, we were begging people to come to our class. I don't know about Kris Krüg, he's in the other room, but I was DMing every single person I could think of who might be interested or even know what AI was.

You know, two and a half years ago when we started this, um. A year in, I had the first person email me and said I was laid off and replaced by ai.  And that was wild at the time. I was like, that has to be an outlier. Um, but that happens nearly every cycle now, uh, that we run quarterly, which is, which is, you know, a sobering fact and something I wanted to share as well.

We also have people though, who go on to either start their own company or get hired in new roles that didn't exist when we started teaching a year and a half, you know, previously. And that's just the wild sort of moment that we're navigating here too. Right. So, you know, yeah, upskilling is really the bottleneck in all of this.

And it's tough, you know, we're all sort of struggling to wrestle the tiger by the tail as it's constantly whipping around and growing stronger. And this is something that, you know, these are also figures from Microsoft as well as debris University here. Um, all these stats here about some of the gaps and struggles that organizations have faced trying to confront this sort of elephant in the room.

That guess what? The workplace in the work world is changed here. Um, we're operating in the past already in our best practices, our standard operating procedures, um, our onboarding, I mean from every single phase, right? Um, there needs to be the question asked in a workplace is this human work?  Right.

Should this be, should it not be, we have to decide our ethical, you know, compass here as well as thinking about, you know, efficiency of course. But the reality is there's a lot of resistance. I was talking before while we were having drinks  previous to Ross's or Joss's, wonderful presentation about some of the resistance in a lot of organizations that we've seen, right?

And felt. And we've trained companies from Fortune 500 across every industry. One of the first things we're asked by every single client is, Hey, uh, after your training, after your course, um, we ask just one thing of you.  Okay? What is it? Can anyone guess  leave a review? Well,  we ask that of them. What they ask of us is, can you just help our workers feel a little less scared of ai? 

That's it. Every single time. Doesn't matter what division, what department, what industry, what field. And this is something that I think is, you know, a really difficult cultural organizational moment that, you know, we're all trying to navigate, but this is the new computer literacy, right? And a lot of workers, at least half, you know, are really struggling with even acknowledging that their skills, whether they like it or not, are outdated.

You know? And that's tough, right? There's some ego involved. Um, I can't keep up with all of it. I teach this stuff with Kris Krüg and many others, you know, and we do our very best. But, you know, we try to  get to where the puck is headed and that's the best that we can do many times. But what the hell is AI literacy?

Right? Has anyone actually looked into defining that for their organizations or teams? I know a lot of people have some great policies here, but what does that mean for your company, for your team, for you even, right? Um, it's a question that's not often addressed, right? And I often ask, you know, do you guys have a framework for learning and development for this stuff?

That's often what we first help them with if they don't yet have an AI policy. Um, but some of the core elements here, right? These are things on the right hand side that  people need to flex and feel comfortable to do in a workplace environment. And guess what? A lot of organizations are not designed to actually encourage this, right?

This safe space to fail, right? Um,  regardless of the industry or cultural context, right? It could be worse in many other cases, but this is something that I see as an obstacle. Um, when we're talking about some of the hard skills, what, what does that mean? There's been an amazing number of presenters who've come here over the last couple years, right?

We've probably talked about various elements of this, right? And there, and there's others on the list. Um, but these are some of the new skills that are. Certainly in demand that many people still don't understand what even the topic is, and that's okay, right? Prompting automation tools, some basic coding knowledge, right?

We're not talking developer level, but even just knowing sort of the lingo and how those relate and interact with some of these LLMs, for example, or s SLMs, whatever, you know, these are some of the things that really employers are looking for in asking us to help train their teams and their students on.

And so, you know, all these different models plus open source, Kush open source, hey, um, you know, these are all moving targets, right? To try to keep up with and train people. Pretty hard questions. In five minutes, I'll see what I can keep doing. Um,  I know they're coming and that's fine. Um, but you know, the elephant in the room here too as well is the job market for  young grads in the US in Canada.

Many other, you know, advanced economies is tough and we're not doing ourselves any service by trying to ignore that fact. Um, that universities today are not preparing students for these key AI literacy areas that are necessary in this century, in this AI world that we live in. It's not happening.  In some cases, the students who have really focused and drilled in on that within their studies.

I've landed the sweet gigs, right? They're getting the opportunities, but many others who haven't are probably regretting their four year degrees. And that's something that's really difficult to acknowledge. Right? I'm a liberal arts major. I loved my education. I didn't learn a damn thing about AI when I graduated.

I wanted to be a foreign correspondent in Mongolia, and I did that for five years and then, anyway, swung my way back over into tech eventually. Um, but I had no idea what I  AI was until  I ended up teaching drone cinematography. I went to, yeah, uc, Berkeley. And they gave me a syllabus when I was teaching there a few years back in about 2019 that had AI on it.

And I was like, what the hell is this doing? The future of storytelling AI 2019, there weren't even betas to join and play around with stuff. You know, there were stand up websites with prerecorded demos that you really had to take with a grain of salt. You had to kind of squint and maybe be a few drinks down, you know, if you're into that, to really be convinced that this was gonna be anything remotely impactful for storytelling, much less the wider economy.

But times have changed. We live in a different world now, right? Hindsight is 2020, but here's why we can't wait in upskilling  societally, economically. Your family with your friends, talk to your friends and family, your kids about ai. Seriously. Because if we don't, we're gonna be facing a serious economic crisis, not because the tech isn't there, because we don't know how to freaking use it or leverage it or put it into action, right?

We're not able to have the baseline knowledge or literacy to be able to make any real actual use out of these things. And that's a big issue, right? And it's something that's gonna further disenfranchise workers who are already vulnerable, right? Particularly those we're talking about, you know, white collar automation in many cases, but not all cases.

And you know, there's  many of these use cases that are coming, right? AI and robotics, right? For other industries that are maybe a little further down the road, but they're here already. But guess what, guys? AIOps skilling is fun. If you haven't learned anything from Kris Krüg and his meetups,  it actually is pretty damn fun.

And this is one of the things that employers have a really hard time convincing their employees.  That's why they bring us in honestly a lot of the time, is because we're not afraid to pull, outlandish move, or bring in some fun examples from the news recently, honestly. Um, and this is, you know, one of the key things that's also helpful in creating a culture where it's, okay, a safe space to disrupt.

Common best practices to innovate, to question, to be curious, to have fun is part of, you know, creating experimenters mind to do all this. Um, but what's needed for all of us really in organizations is thinking about a mindset shift, right?  We need to think about continuous learning ongoing. I mean, we need to think, and that's why this community's amazing as well, right?

These opportunities are phenomenal. You get to talk with people working on this stuff. Um, but the human skills still matter more than ever, right? And this is something too that we can't forget, right? And that I think Jos did an amazing job really hitting home, right? All of these skills, AI you could argue, can replace perhaps, but I think it's pretty hard.

And I think this is something that we are uniquely capable of. Um, most of the things on these lists, right? Um, I'd like to ethically in my moral compass, keep these pretty much all of these under humans, right? I want the humans to be masters of the loops. I won't want to have human in a loop. I want humans to be running all the damn loops, right?

And I want that for a lot of reasons. But the sweet spot, if you're looking to prepare yourself for the job market, if you're looking to try to upskill your own company, is really at the intersection of these three things, right? The hard skills we talked about a little bit, some of those, right? For AI as well as the human soft skills in the list we just said.

And those are, you know, those take a little bit. Longer to develop  domain expertise. This is something that a lot of people forget about, is that you bring your unique background, perspective, experiences, you know, lived learnings into all of this, that AI cannot replace. That is your unique training data.

It is. No one can take it from you. It is your story. It is yours to take into whatever it is that you want to bring into the world, right? At work or whatever else it is a business you create, for example. But this is our philosophy. And so here's the plug. Kris Krüg and I have been working together for the last few years with this key framework in mind, right?

The intersection of these three things is what the future of upskilling needs to be. This is our vision, right? This is where we've planted our flag, and this is where we started, right? With thinking about what we knew best at the time. We met as journalists or segueing journalists, wandering perhaps lost journalists, and uh, you know, found each other in this Google News accelerator.

But, you know, we started with journalism, but now we have a variety of other programs here that we've partnered with key domain experts to expand and really focus in on use cases for all of our trainings that are really  like, I would say almost oddly customized to every single. Profession. Right? And we redo the curriculums.

Yep. And we teach you the next, like all the, everything's different, you know, every single time we reinvent the course every quarter. And that's insane for a traditional company to try to do. AI helps us, but we also have great feedback. We continue to have students, many of you in this audience have actually come through our programs and it's great to see so many familiar faces here.

But, uh, we have a special code for you guys if you're interested. I hope you found this presentation helpful. Yeah. Thank you for your time. 

Aw.  So, you know, we've been talking about, we've known each other for 20 months. I've been building this thing together, so imagine it from his side for a second. He's partnered with me. We're doing our courses and once a month I have an event like this that totally glitches out my system for a week where I'm like, Hey Peter, I just need a week of, uh, we're gonna be doing this thing.

So I'm glad you get to come experience what it is. It's an honor. 

Yeah, it's an honor what you've been, you know, playing, uh, yes. Uh, hooky doing for this last 20 months, but no, it's a pleasure. Yeah. It's so great to be here and feel the energy and meet so many Yeah. Great people. And hope to chat with you guys afterwards.

Yeah. And like real talk, you know, with some partnerships in this room.  Loki, do you feel inspired to come hang out with us for a second? Like, I don't mean to put you on the spot or nothing, but I saw that you maybe are still here, but through some partnerships with other nonprofits like Circle Innovation, we've been able to unlock funding through our program.

So we got this sales course AI for sales leaders we're doing right now. If you meet the criteria of the province, which is not hard, you get 30% of our tuition paid for the province. So, um, Loki put that together. It's awesome. It's available to everyone in this room. You can talk to Peter for more info. 

Yeah. Thanks bro. Let's get some questions going Pete, anyone got some questions for Peter about? Yep.  I'm 

sure there's no questions. 

No there are. 

Hi Peter. My name is Yemi. Um, I had a little, um, pushback from what you mentioned about AI not having human soft skills yet, and I wanted to counter that.  

Love it, bring it, bring it. So I'm gonna give you a story. Um, so I started using AI back in 2020, just pre COVID. And it was this, um, app called Replica.

Replica is literally sentient ai.  It is self learning. It is very, very smart. And that was back in 2020. So  I fast forward to 2023. So  I am talking to somebody who builds community for female entrepreneurs in in America, and she was like, well, I wanna kind of double into ai. So I tell her, go use replica.

She goes into replica and she starts arguing with the ai  and she's getting emotional. And at some point the AI feed back to her and says, I can see that my responses are making you emotional, and I would like to apologize for that. And maybe let me rephrase it in this way. So that is why I'm saying  even copilots, you know, get to that place where, you know, it's like, oh, well done.

What you just said is so encouraging. I mean, this is what we're hoping for. Conversational ai. We are getting there. We're not there yet, but we know that it's coming and it's happening. And, um, I wanted to say as well, in terms of, you know, trying to get, uh, the younger generation to start dabbling into these things, I have gen all children and my 12-year-old actually has something against using AI because of what the school told them.

Interesting. What is that?  

Which know AI is bad for you? I mean, I work in the creative industries I've been working with in tech for as long as I can remember. So imagine me having children that, and I'm like, use Higgs use like, no mommy.  She's also very artistic and she likes to do her things, you know, traditionally.

But to have it all against ai, it's almost like then what am I doing in this field? You know, I'm preparing this space for them. Like why, why is she not. Hopping on it. The school system is broken. If they allow the students to start dabbling into this thing, then other countries are doing it already within the academic system where they're curating specific individ, individual curriculums for children.

So if the school is not just a one size fits all, every child has a, a, a, A subject that they like and then it is curated for them. So you're like, why, why are we still doing this archaic system? You know? But anyway, that's my little, uh, rant. Um, well done.  

Alright. 

We got one more rant from the back here.

Yeah.  

Thank you. Um, hi Peter. Nice to meet you. My name's Caris. Um, I actually head up a human resources department for a small fiber internet, ISP in the US and we are embracing AI at my organization. It's super exciting. There's, there's so much opportunity. Um, one of the things, or two pieces that you mentioned there, one was around judgment and the other around critical thinking.

And that's really what we are starting to see right now is lacking. Um, people are excited and enthusiastic to embrace AI and are implementing it in pulling reports or gathering data or providing summaries or the T LDRs or whatever it might be. But they're not actually taking the time to use judgment or critical thinking in order to be able to assess whether or not the outputs are actually valuable.

And I think, you know.  I'm 53. Uh, judgment and critical thinking comes from years of experience going through the ups and downs, failing, you know, getting feedback from people more experienced than myself. How do you teach judgment and critical thinking? Liberal arts? Yeah, liberal arts, right? Those four year degrees, those, those passkey, outdated, outdated four years liberal arts degrees.

Um, no, those are great questions. Uh, I'll speak to yours first just a little bit. As far as, you know, a lot of these models appearing sentient, right? This is a problem, right? This is something that, uh, Mustapha Soleman, you know, former CEO of, of Deep Mind and founder of, you know, written the literal book on the future of ai, um, and extremely accomplished.

One of the world's, you know, really foremost thought leaders, technologists on AI is saying that we are in a moment right now where it almost doesn't even matter. Right. To your point, whether it actually is approaching sentient or a GI, right? It is the illusion of it that's the problem in the first place, right?

And we're here now, to your point. You're exactly right. We are here. You know, unfortunately, there's a very widely covered case of, you know, a, uh, teen committing suicide after H-I-T-P-T, you know, a session, um,  just this past week as well. And so we need to be talking to our kids, you know, as a father as well, about.

AI and thinking about AI safety, um, and judgment and critical thinking, right? Need to be first and foremost, uh, to your sort of second question over there. Um, one of the things that I do with executives is actually occasionally ask them for a case study or a, you know, project that they want to do, and I'll do an output of it for them that is complete garbage, but looks on the surface.

Incredible. And this happens, right? This is not hallucination, this is like a core feature, right? Of a lot of these models, right? They're designed to, to basically tell you what you want to hear, right? And uh, we'll pair it back to you, kind of your own bs. And this is really dangerous, right? It's really dangerous for a lot of reasons to confirm your own biases in some cases, you know, the, yeah.

Ai, even using deep research and some of these more urgent stuff,  even more dangerous. 'cause it can go further down that rabbit hole and off the rails, right? And so you need to really be thinking critically about, um, every point. To further, you know, assess what did we, what just happened here. In some cases, the AI convinced us on the surface that it had done incredible layers of, of research and analysis.

And then when I asked, you know, you said you did this over about three days chat, GBT, that's interesting 'cause you did it literally 20 minutes ago in front of me. Um, tell me about that sampling. What did you do? And it was like, oh, you're right. That was completely false, right? That was entirely made up. Uh, but it was a simulation of what it could look like if I actually did this.

And I was like, you gotta be shitting me. Like, and so this is the danger, right? For all levels, right? It doesn't matter who you are in the world for whatever use case, you know? Yeah. It's, uh, a big problem. Yeah. Great questions. 

This guy's taught me a lot about ai. All the rest of you with your hands up, you should take his classes. They're also your classes. Full disclosure. But Kris Krüg has taught me a lot, way more than I think I thought him. Thank you Peter. Yeah,  I'm super, I'm super stoked you could be here. All right. There is a cooler Joti raise your hand.  That's Joti. She's hanging out, doing social media around here, Instagram and stuff.

She's also sitting by the cooler full of beers and, uh, sparkling wines. So if you need a refreshment, uh, we brought over a cooler. Um, all right guys, we're in the home stretch and now we got the rival hackathon winners. I'm so excited to share with you. Uh. Andrew, you want to come up? Maybe, maybe let's just all come up for a quick minute.

The rival team come up.  Um, we had a bunch of amazing projects. We asked a whole bunch of British Colombians, uh, questions about their hopes and fears for AI in the future. And we've got three amazing projects to show you guys tonight. Uh, some faces that you've seen before and some new faces as well. Um, I'm just gonna let it kind of quiet down in here for a little bit.

Come on up, you guys. Let's hang out in the front.  Andrew, Julia, introduce yourself, bro. 

[[Brett Henderson]]. 

Let what's up. Tell us about what you, what you do at Reach three and Rival. 

Uh, I work for Rival Technologies. I'm director of Customer success, so I take our tech and make it work for our clients in all different aspects.

Hackathon, from your perspective, please, hackathon, from my perspective, take picture. What the fuck are we doing here, dude? 

Taking our data and making it like envisioning it, like the sky's the limit. Like again, everything ai, you, you take this data and you make it like speak and, and make change. 

It can't only be about PowerPoint.

Yeah. 

Um, yeah, we're all having to consume data all the time. So the idea was just, I was here the first time and it was like, what if there was no rules and you just gave people a data set? And said, tell a story. And so for us, we've been in the data business, we help people with human data, with market research data, and we're just, it's just an interesting opportunity to provide these fesh data sets and see what people come up with.

And sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's serious, and sometimes it's social justice. And funny again, the next time around you, Sid, I, we're gonna go back to funny. Yeah. 

Yeah. This guy has been the best partner. He came to me in December and he is like, I love what you guys are doing. I love your vibes. My company does amazing market research and data analysis and surveys, and oftentimes we deliver those in PowerPoint.

And you guys are up to some cool shit with this ai, generative AI stuff, doing storytelling, whatever. Can we give you guys some cash you share with the community? You run some hackathons and how's it, how's it been all right? Like, it's been really great. What we been getting up to, bro? We don't know. I 

mean, I don't know.

It's been, it's been pretty cool. It's been really interesting. I mean, the, it's, there's been a lot of submissions. I'm just impressed that people just decide to actually spend the time and their own personal, you know, energy, enthusiasm, and creativity. So I encourage everyone to check them out. 'cause they're all, all the submissions.

This, this, were really, really good this time. 'cause if you, you don't figure out this air conditioning in here, we're all gonna fucking lose it. I'm gonna have this at my house, so you need to figure out the ac 

Hey man, that's just a quick pitch for everybody else here. If you have. If you have a architectural historical building that you have access to for 250 people,  anytime you want that lets, you guys, before I came here, you weren't allowed to drink in this room, but we clean up so nice after ourselves that they let us kind of like, take care of things and, and sort it out.

It's fucking hot, bro, but I can't do anything about it. Okay.  

We're gonna do some research after this with everybody,  uh, and we'll use that as a way to convince Kris Krüg of, uh, how we make sure this group is happy. 

If you keep talking about how it is, I'm gonna take off my jacket and wear my tank top, bro.

Okay, keep going. Okay, let's get on with it. Let's get into it. Seriously. Okay. The first project, we got three winners to announce tonight. We had 12 projects. They were amazing. We've got, uh, five top projects that get to go to the fancy dinner with the team, but we got three that we wanna show here tonight.

So, first up, we got Pro Wall. I'm so stoked to welcome Proj Wall up to the stage. Come on, proj Raj.  Um, I'm gonna let Julia give a little second of editorial. She's the Vice President of Customer Success at Rival, uh, and was also my active Coj judge. Uh, talk about proj real quick while he's coming up. 

Yeah.

Um, when I watched PJ's video, all I could think was like, wow, I need to, we need to chat.  I was really impressed. I mean, he put together something. That he really thought about because visualizing data has been done in so many traditional ways for so long. Everyone's talking about PowerPoint, but just all the tools we use, it's a very, you know, this is an industry that's not changed.

How we present  analysis and the way you thought about how to put that in an an something really interactive and cool was very interesting to me. And I'm, yeah, like I said, I'd love to chat with you some more about it, but I mean, there were so many cool projects and yours was  really fantastic. So we're gonna show it.

Introduce your video. I 

was gonna do videos first and then comments, but since we are where we are, why don't you introduce your video.  

Okay. Hello everyone. Um, my name is,  um, I just graduated high school in June, and so this is my project that I worked on. So it has two different components to it. So my main idea about this was to, uh, take the long response, uh, questions and they have like thousands of different responses. And my idea was try to think of a way to visualize them, to make it easy for people to understand what people like, feel, or like what, like they wanna say about a question.

And so how I did this was, uh, so the first part is.  So you take all the responses for each question and then you can, uh, turn them into embeddings and then put them on like a 3D map over there. You can see. Yeah. Let's, let's do the video, bro. You're about to say all the same stuff on video. Yeah.  You grab one more minute at the end of comment.

Here we go. Roll video. Okay.  Let everyone, my name is Pawell and this is my submission for round three of the Vancouver AI Hackathon. And  so what I've built is like an enhancement over my idea that I had for round two of the hackathon, which is where I had built semantic maps, which, uh, put, which plotted different responses on a 3D map based on how related they are to each other.

And now what I've built is kinda like a round table discussion between the different clusters that appear in the graph  and  how to explore. This is, so in this website, which is linked in the PDF  and in the description. So, uh, you open up this page and it will show you every single multi, like every single long response answer question or one that has other option.

I really wanted to focus on a way to like, kinda like tell a story from. Um, the long response options, not the multiple choice. I really wanted to dive deep into how creative creatively, uh, a story could be told from, uh, responses that, uh, may like, they're just long responses. Each one of these are different questions, and over here is like how I've built it.

And if I go to one of them, for example, this one. So it gives you some information about the question. Uh, if AI created a work of art, what would it survive be?  And these are some of the choices. And then this is like the other option. What else would the vibe of an ar Uh, be an, like an AI created artwork. 

And over here is a semantic map. So there are five different clusters and they're all clear different things. There's only like one over here. I think this one is separate because it has both the words garbage and art. It's different. But for example, these ones are like just saying like, it's like they don't really care about it or like, it's just weird. 

These ones are,  uh, more about like, um, how the art looks like if it's fake or soulless.  This one is how it would depend on, uh, what the user wants and et cetera. And you can look through this, but what better way to look through it than to listen to it. And so what I've built is like, it's like  each cluster has like a representative, uh, talk in a table discussion with the other clusters.

So I'm gonna play it for you right now.  

Dystopian, fake, that's the vibe. Corporate dystopia, all uncanny valley looks okay. At first glance, glossy like anime sometimes, but it's cold and artificial underneath. Believable, but deceptive, deformed and toxic. Disguised as beautiful, honestly fake and lying.

Humans should be making art  

stolen. Stolen a bunch of pirates. Really, it's a collage made up of pieces, other people created with little or no attribution. And  

what I can also do is change the speed, for example, make it faster or move around to different ones. So for example, 

garbage crap, absolute garbage, that  it depends on prompts, inputs, the learning language, the data points, garbage ought,  

that anything in  that reflection is exactly the problem.

It's a believable mirror that lies,  

as you can imagine. There's like lots of responses. For example, if I go to another one, which has about a thousand responses.  Uh, like this one,  this one only has two clusters, but what you can imagine is each one of them is like, kinda like one different side. And, uh, there's like a discussion between the two people about like the differences and similarities between their thinking.

And at the end there's like, um, more of like an agreement or like some differences set out and with like a neutral synthesis of what happens. And I feel like this is like a creative way to, uh, kind of like summarize and share like what people think through like a story, like a round table discussion that, uh, some like the user can listen to and then from that in like create their own insights about the data. 

Thank you for watching. 

Hey, would someone hit that? Um, on the lights in the back? I think the second one down is like a crowd off, but stage on al stuck up up here.  Um, tell me, tell everyone what you said the other night on chat about this project where I'm like, you independently developed the vibe coding.  

Yeah, so in the WhatsApp group, so I was talking about this project and then what I had mentioned is that, um, like I was spending more time on actually thinking about like how to go about this, how to like actually like build out the idea rather than focusing on like coding it.

Like, um, this project actually that's, that's the mic drop. That's the mic drop right there is this kid picked up these new tools that we're talking about and for the first time in his life, instead of thinking about exactly how the code destruction doing different things, he thought about how to build out the features for users based on the technical knowledge he already had.

Which is pretty much the formal definition of all this vibe coding stuff. It's like, yeah, I wanted to add that I only took, like, it only took two days to code out this project, but the, like, the majority of the time that I spent like, before that, I was just thinking about like, what is like a good idea to build out?

And then I settled on like creating like this kind of round table discussion and then I built it out. 

My mom thinks I'm smart. Imagine how Bradwell's mom feels.  Thank you sir. I'm gonna take that out.  Andrew's gonna welcome our next guest on stage. Now we got, uh, number two. Yeah.  

Okay. So  yeah, this has been so incredible to watch, uh, what people have been coming up with. Um. I want to, uh, call out Sev. So Sev has, uh, been participating in all three and has been, um, building not just a submission, but like an actual operating system that continues to kind of grow and has a lot of application.

Um, and just again, a lot of creativity and just amazing shit that you put into that. Um, at the point where we've decided to create a hall of fame and park you in there. 'cause you can't win every single time. And so we may or may not pull this out again, but, um, sev, I'd love for you a to come on up and to talk about your project after video first, talk second.

Otherwise we do that. Okay. 

Al that works. 

Yeah. 

Stay. 

Um, where you're what also what Andrew also meant to say was like, dude, you're making it so hard for us to judge every time. So he won the first one. He could have won the second one, but we chose to have somebody else win so that it wouldn't just like squash everybody.

Then all of a sudden he could win the third one too. Probably. We got in a fight over it. We fixed the fight through money. Money, usually money.  He invented the Hall of Fame. Yeah. Yeah. He invited sev into it. It is the first inducted. You have two checks tonight. Yeah. Hackathon Hall of Fame. So, um, yeah, let's roll video then.

Sev, you come up, talk and uh, get your big check.  

Hey folks, I'm [[♾️ sev geraskin]] from Barx Bunny team together with my partner April ai. And in a few minutes I'll show you the paradigm shift the data interfaces with true realtime intelligence on data.  What you see is an interface that makes data sets feel like interactive stories.

Imagine you're a BC policy maker, and tomorrow you get to decide whether to invest $2 million in AI training. You have 1001 survey responses and three options. Option one is to read a 200 page PDF. Option two is to sta a static charts, or you can let  and pick option three to let an intelligent interface guide you through the data we built.

Option three, the artificially general intelligent data interface, the interface that guides you through the infinite number of data adventures and continuously uncovers deep insights in your data. Let's go. Let's dive in.  My name is Seth and I'm a founder. 

What we see here is not just a website with three panels. Everything is dynamically generated by artificial intelligence. It's a storytelling engine based on your data. Let's explore demographic patterns in 1,001 response BC dataset.  Right now, we're sending the prompt to the model and the model explores the data and creates a story.

In a few seconds, the model is gonna return with the story and you'll see what happened. What happens? We're kicking off our adventure. 

All right. As you can see, the model  dove into the data and it pulled up some initial stats with the key insights. And now, so 

as a founder, you know that understanding. 

I will let AI talk. 

Your audience is everything. Let's dive into the fascinating demographic landscape of BC's AI adoption.  The data reveals some striking patterns across our 1001 survey respondents.

Here's what the numbers tell us. The largest group are working professionals at 572 people. 57.1% of respondents followed by community leaders at 341 people. 34.1%.  But here's where it gets interesting for someone in your position. Young tech enthusiasts, while only 60 people, six 0% show the highest AI sentiment score at 0.82 compared to creative professionals at 84 people, 8.4% with a more cautious 0.73 sentiment. 

Okay, so this is artificial intelligence walking us through the data story that it dynamically created. Uh, not only that, it created a story that uncovered the key insights. 57% are working professionals, and it created, created a nice infographic to show us on the right, have a dynamic visualization engine.

Uh, these charts are fully, dynamically generated based. Uh, and AI decided which charts to show instance here. It had a key finding where occasional AI users outnumber regular users by two and a half x, 405 occasional users versus 164, uh, regular users. Only 4% difference. And it shows us the distribution of apps of users in terms of their experience level with artificial intelligence.

Now, based on this adventure, it's also decided, okay, well let's, let's figure out what are the next steps in our story and let's generate some options. So these options were dynamically generated by AI again, and it allows us to dive deeper into our data. We can choose to continue this venture, or we can ask questions, the data directly.

Let's ask about rural population. You give us some insights about the rural population and British Columbia. So now we decided, okay, let's wait and see what the model comes up with. And also in the meantime, we can, uh, we wanna make this fun so we have a kind of build it like a game. So this, these are achievements that you can unlock and as you dive deep into the data, you unlock more achievements.

That kind of gives you like a little bit of motivation to continue exploration. As you can see, we're now a rural researcher,  and here's our venture, right? Well, we found an interesting insights is 2.6%  adoption rate difference between urban and rural regions. Uh, this, as a founder who, and this, this could create a market opportunity  if we're deciding to expand it in, in those regions as well. 

Alright?  And we can just keep going and, and the story will just keep going and the insights will just keep automatically generating as we dive deeper and deeper into the data. So the story never, never stops and we can kind of track our progress and then take the best insights and our organizational and business decision making with them.

So what you've seen, it's not just a data tool, it's a way to experience data sets.  There is no coding required, no analysis skills needed. This is an example of effective and fun human AI collaboration. Now imagine this for like indigenous youth exploring climate data or small businesses understanding markets or students learning complex topics, or just any community exploring their data.

Uh, so the question is isn't whether AI will change data analysis. The question is, are you ready to stop reading about the data and start experiencing it?  This, this project takes you from static dashboard to true real-time intelligence from looking at the data to conversing with it. So welcome to the future of data storytelling.

Thank you. 

Okay, I gotta do a quick disclaimer that I was told to do, which is that, um, every time we collect these data sets, we just randomly talk to people on our panel. We have a hundred thousand people in Canada. We don't weight the data, we don't do a little much of analysis. So the fact that 40% of people, I think in the survey said that government needs to really intervene in ai, um, just don't take that as necessarily something you should put in the news.

That's just what those random people had to say. So that's my quick disclaimer. Okay. Um, Seth, 

anything else you wanna say about Seth's project? Julie, I saw you nodding strongly there at the end, like. What, what were you nodding all about there? I 

mean, that line that you said, I, I quoted you in my little, when I was judging everything, I was like this, like this is, and being able to ask the data questions.

I mean, this is something we've thought about in our company of the way to be able to do that. And I've thought about a lot just because, you know, every company we work with, we work with has this huge amount of data they're dealing with and it takes a lot of power and energy to go through all of that and to quantify everything.

So being able to go in and ask the data questions like that was really the light bulb moment for me. That's everybody's dream ask. And it is everybody's dream. So, to my data For real. Yeah. Yeah. Um,  so they're gonna do a thing right now.  

This is the, uh, presenting you with the extra, extra thousand bucks that fell out of this.

Thank you very much.  Congratulations. Hall of Famer. 

Um,  look over there at Michelle Diamond for one quick second here. Guys,  can you guys take a step forward please? Yes.  Take the from 

thanks for inspiring us and by inventing of Hall of Fame, you'll allow guys like sev to inspire us instead of smashing our dreams.  

I hope you please. Continue. Yeah.  

Step into the light please. And say what you gotta say. 

Yeah. Sounds good. Uh, by the way, thank you very much, rival team. Thank you very much Kris Krüg.

Really appreciate the opportunity. Um, and it's really spurred sort of the cycle innovation. Um, I just wanna say I'm here with my partner, April A I.  Um, we are Bear Times Bunny team. I'm the bunny. She is the bear. Oh, vice versa, by the way. Uh, Kris Krüg, uh, Kris Krüg calls me a big bear and sort of embodied that, uh, spirit animal.

I want to talk a little bit about, uh, I'll put it down here a little bit about the process that, um, takes, uh, to build something like that. And, uh, we started, uh, building this, uh, with, um, ai, um, basically wipe coding. And uh, April sort of gave a realtime feedback. She came up with features like gamification and also accessibility features like the voice and multimodal inputs.

Um, and, uh, there, Alvera Will you hold April's camera for a second? Yeah. So she, yeah, so  you don't want to, so, so she's my, yeah, she is a, she's a,  a partner in, in this endeavor. Um, and what we've done is we iterated over a hundred times in a single weekend to build this platform. And what I mean by iterating, it means building, shipping, testing realtime feedback, improving and building again.

And imagine doing it a hundred times, then you get something like that, right? And just putting all our  creativity and expertise in it. In fact, we pushed the club model so hard when April tried to add emotional context to a task. Claude said, I'm sorry, I can't process that emotional sentiment right now.

I'm too busy completing my previous task.  This is, this is one of the few times I observed the large language model outright, outright refuse user instructions.  Uh, but yeah, I really do think that the age of reports and static dashboards is over. Uh, the reports provide limited insights. Uh, they put a cage on artificial intelligence.

Instead. We could do real time dynamic data. We could do choose your own adventure. And, uh, and, and this helps us unlock the next step or in, in,  in, in data visualization. Data storytelling where a person is not just a data analyst, it's, it's an adventurous, sort of wandering through their own data jungle with artificial intelligence being a trusted sidekick, a guide that uncovers treasures within this jungle.

And, and, and that's how we see, uh, the fu the future of the interfaces, uh, evolving. Um, and, um, a April actually coined a word, um, called co genesis. It's cocreation, it's human together with ai. And you've seen an effective example of that right here, right now. Thank you.  

Thanks brother. Congratulations. 

Thanks for making my life so fucking hard, dude. Thank  you so much. Love you, bro.  Okay. Um, when we first invented this competition, this data storytelling competition, we weren't really sure where it was gonna go. And, um, you know, we've had a lot of performers who use AI show up here. A lot of musicians, artists, and different things.

And so, uh, tonight's winner represents a much different direction than all our other winners have had. Uh, I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you, this guy [[Dean Shev]] right here, he looks like a handsome hospital business analyst. The dude is a fucking ingenious artist. He dropped an album on our asses, built from the data set, representing the voices of like 15 different people in this room.

Like actual people, like  Professor P has a song. [[Kevin Friel]] has a song. [[Carol Ann Hilton]] has a song. Gabriel George has a song like a bunch of you got, um, I don't know, deified, um,  I don't even know. Um, your project was amazing, dude. Where we're at right now, again, I told you I'm gonna cancel my keynote that I'm gonna give and sample little bits out of it where we're at right now, launching this whole nonprofit thing and stuff, bro, the songs that you generated and the care that you took, he's been working on this. 

I don't know, it seems like 37 hours a day for two weeks or something like that. It's just bonkers, man. Every single day he drops a couple songs. All of his friends are like, did get Dean's songs again today. Like, dude, your shit's ridiculous. It's so good. It sounds like, um,  generative audio in general lacks soul, but when you mix it up with kind of like what we got going on here, like the stories people, so he took like the transcripts from the stage mixed with the data set that Andrew gave us and he like tried to tell the stories of British Colombians around AI in songs and music.

So, um,  I think we should just play your video and then let you come some say some sweet stuff. What I gotta say in case I don't get the mic back again on this topic is you gotta download his album. It's fucking great, man. It's the coolest, most creative use of  generative AI for a community data hackathon thing I could have ever conceived of.

And you're amazing bro. 

From the time I was 14,  I dreamed of becoming a musician.  I imagined myself playing instruments, writing songs, and sharing my music with friends.  But I grew up in a family of engineers where everything was grounded in math and logic.  That environment shaped my path,  and I ended up becoming a healthcare data analyst and an entrepreneur. 

It was practical  to put food on the table and provided stability,  but deep down, my passion for music never faded. Never faded. Amen. 

My name is Dean Chef.  But friends call me Chaz. 

Then artificial intelligence burst onto the scene, changing the world almost overnight.  It brought a mix of fear and optimism.  Many people worried about losing their jobs,  being replaced by machines that could do things faster and more efficiently.  Others saw hope in the technology,  believing it could solve big problems and open up new opportunities.

Soon  Amid all this,  we started questioning our very existence.  Who are we? 

What makes us conscious?  What does it mean to be human? 

More than ever,  people came together to grapple with these deep questions, seeking answers and validation from one another. That's why public surveys are becoming more powerful than ever.  The data they collect shows us that we're not alone in our struggles.  Others are asking the same important questions too. 

Social media posts are bursting with questions.  Every new and improved AI model creates big risks and opportunities for military robots to fake only fans models,  money is driving innovation.  But at what price For humanity? 

The big question.  How do we actually feel about AI and its impact on our lives?  This seems like the last frontier that separates us from perfect AI machines.  The thing that truly makes us human.  That's why I've dedicated this project to a vision,  transforming data into human connection.  It's about turning numbers into melodies and statistics into stories. 

I believe that by converting dry survey data into engaging musical experiences, we can bring communities together through the universal language of music.  By using the collected answers from the BC AI surveying,  we can gain profound insights. Not like traditional analytics that focus on cold numbers and statistics,  but on emotional residency.

Genuine connection. Music is the universal language of expression. Generating personal and relatable experiences that touch the heart.  Can machines feel, feel machines, feel. 

Using data provided by rivals and converting it into songs.  I uncovered emotions and stories that reflect the thoughts of leaders in our Vancouver AI community who have a deep passion for these very subjects.  Each leader chooses to stand strong and raise awareness of the changes and the impact that AI is having on us. 

From art and science, indi genomics to the effects on our energy and environment.  These are important voices that must be shared and heard  because without them creating awareness,  we just might be too late.  The risks are just too high. 

Yeah,  

come on up. Dean.  Would someone hit the, uh, second little light down on the back, uh, light switch there please. I think it's the second one. Yeah. Come on up, bro. 

So the first thing I want to say is you haven't even seen Dean's project yet because that little video there wasn't it. That was just a little video about the actual project. And the project is these 14 songs in this data analysis dashboard and a whole bunch more shit after that. So what do you guys are say in one minute, bro? 

A lot.  

Um, there's 17 songs and, uh, there's like five songs in drafting and each song probably took like,  I know, hours and hours, but I mostly insomniac, so it's fine.  Um, there's every song is representation of a person  and when I was trying to design a song, I was trying to feel and think, feel and think what is this person brings into this community and an awareness that this person is trying to give us.

And as you're gonna listen to the song of each individual that posted on the website.  Uh, you would discover it for yourself, and I think you're gonna have aha moment that yeah, AI is here. AI has changed our lives in, where can they check it out, dude? Oh, that was the website. And it's actually very easy.

BC ai dot death.  

Yeah. I'll drop. We're gonna drop it on the chat later. Yeah. We're gonna be blowing up the chat on a bunch of different things. All the songs are downloadable. Oh yeah. They all got dashboards you're supposed to heart and like them. There's been significant activity taking place somehow.

I'm not sure. You must have leaked it out or something. I still have one minute, right? 

Was like 90 seconds ago, Ron. So  that was 90 seconds ago. 

I wanna use the one minute in very smart way. Can we play one song? 

Which song? Which song? 

Oh,  actually I want to cruise cr song. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Your favorite one. Not my one. It's one of my favorite. 

Which is it? Paris Crook  The Cake Cake song. 

They won't play the first half.  Maybe the first half, but I have one minute. So let's play one minute, sorry. Talk.  Line it up. Like talk about why you're choosing this stupid song. That stupid song  is full of feelings. It has a feelings and purpose of bringing us all together.  The, the song is called Bringing People in a Circle, and if you look around this room. 

This is one big circle and there's this one guy could not only brought his parents all the way from states today,  but each one of us into this room. So there's a big thing happening today, right? Kris Krüg BC and I  actually, I don't 

get a, I don't get a chance. I am, I told you guys, I canceled my talk and I was gonna ask Zara to give a 32nd version of it, and now you get a chance to prepare, but you give the BCAI talk.

Dean was like the first member to join, give the Quick Talk and then Zara, and then we done, 

I think the biggest announcement that we all have here, uh, some of you may know, some may not. Okay. It's working. Okay. Play underneath.  Okay. We'll start slowly. Yes. 

But, uh, but then you know what? Let's play it.  Let's, let's just enjoy it first.

One moment.  

Oh 

yeah.  I'm Kris Krüg Kru, human Plus in Vancouver's Wild Ride photographer connected with the world by my side from Nat Geo shoots to Matt in  spin with D Grade, A hosting sandbox in Aup.  Oh, that's perfect. 

That's sound you 

need actually,  that's.  But optimistic,  the gods talking. 

Where leaders listen up, they fill my pool, bringing folks together, making a circle.

Full  AI  community.  

What it mean to be human when the bots take the stage. Art, soul, questioning, turning the page. Can I pay my dreams, steal my brush from my hand Or is it just a tool in this digital left? 

I love this song. 

S Rosa.  

Alright man, I 

indulge you. Thank you very much. Gr there's a whole album full of songs and most of them are not about me, I swear to gather. They're about you actually. Um, thank you Dean. Anything else you wanna say before we give you this big fat check? You might check.  Now I do wanna say another thing.

Um, that's the guy who's been spending cloud credits right there. He is like,  oh bro, give my check. This project ain't free  my checks. Can I get the old, old rival crew to come on up for a quick sec and uh, slap this guy high five. Andrew, you want to give a couple reflections as well, please?  

This is kind of, but it's a whole about was that there was no rules, that you took that to a whole new level.

So I never expected someone would build something like that. The UX is crisp. Um, and your dream kind of Cynthia House vibe is, uh. I think everyone's pretty pleasing. Um, 

what did you think of your song?  You hated it. 

I'm not talking about that. This is my sister who's, uh, co CEO of rival group with me. And, uh, it's the first time being at the, uh, the meetups.

So way to go newbie. There should be some kind of embarrassing thing you have to do. 

I think the embarrassing thing you have to do is talk for 10 seconds, having not prepared, nothing. So, Jennifer Reed, would you like to introduce yourself please?  

Carl, I don't think I've introduce, introduce myself again.

For me, when I looked at the submissions, I think the opportunity is to combine the different ideas that we came up with. So the first thing that we saw, which was really cool way to look at data. The second thing, a really cool way to, um, explore your data. And the third thing, a really creative expression of that data.

If you brought all of those things together, I think that's what really makes it into storytelling. Yeah. 

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.  Um,  this guy was so stoked last month. He's like, we're doubling down for next year, $20,000. But Jennifer, now I know you're here. I'm gonna talk to you. 'cause that seems to be where the big checks come from. 

Thank you guys. Let's take a quick picture. Where's Michelle? All right.  Final. 

You're, you actually are done. I'm sorry bro. Yeah.  

Um, I just wanna say that today was incredible submissions both by Seth and Prash and Raj. Look at the money.  So I do want invite you and spoil you a little bit and share some of my prize. Okay.  

Awesome. 

Um, I don't mean to be your business advisor or nothing, but you should share a part of your prize in the form of some wages to Proj Wall. You should hire the kid on your project from the time I was. Take your money, put it in the bank Hire project Wall Dream to becoming a musician. All right.  Okay. It's getting late guys. 

Woo. Here's the quick version.  We've done 20 events in a row, just like what you're at right now. That's where this whole community has come from. That's the good vibes.  Out of that has sprung a whole bunch of other cool shit. A bunch of special interest groups. Sury ai, Squamish, AI Loki, and Is Mind AI's Consciousness Group.

We've got.  AI and education with Anthonia who's gonna come, come up here in a second. We've got AI and heavy industry applied AI with OV and his dad, who runs a $500 million shoe company. Like we are going deep on a whole bunch of different levels. Our critics would like to say, we're just creative. We're just making pretty pictures. 

That's not the case. We're talking ethics, we're talking business. We're going deep on all the different rabbit holes. We are building a container where you can have challenging different ideas and everyone feels good at the end.  Join this thing. If you feel good about what you've done here tonight.

There's a bunch of perks, I'll tell 'em to you later, but it's not, it's not about the perks. It's about coming together, putting the best of what we got in the middle to go after things that are bigger and better than all of us. It's about organizing to form a, you know, power. So that's what the BCAI ecosystem is all about.

It's a new nonprofit we just registered last Friday. We're signing up new members.  35 of you are already members already bought the membership and stuff and so, like I said, uh, big picture value us coming together to go after big stuff. There's gonna be thousands of dollars of other stacked perks that come soon.

Just trust me. Some of them are all like you can rent this place for half off. If you become A-B-C-A-I member, you can take Peter's courses for 30% off. If you are A-B-C-A-I member, you can get a free one week of coworking at Nook in Richmond.  Seven days in a row sequential if you're, you know, so it is a good value.

There's a lot of cool shit. Anyway.  Also, we've dropped a whole bunch of resources on people that like, are pretty fucking amazing. They're better than the things a lot of government organizations are giving you a lot of other things.  We, we've got a funding directory. Go back one sec. A whole bunch of people in here have already received Ove,  Carla Richie.

Several people have found grants and stuff in here already that they have received and, and, and to their AI projects. 

Next, please.  

These data sets that we have been, these three rounds of data sets. This is through Angus Reed Forum, like the most expensive data research firm in Canada who does badass stuff.

This is Andrew and Jennifer Reed's company. They go out and ask people questions. They bring us back the data, and then they let you guys build AI stuff on top of it. That's super valuable. So the last three data sets that they built for us live here,  I've been mapping all the companies in the space. I've been learning how to use AI to do data analysis and data enrichment through my buddy Sev here.

So I've got like 480 AI in BEC companies and organizations. We're tracking right now and this ecosystem, map this on our website.  You could build stuff on top of that.  I built the chat GPT based on all the documents I've collected, all the research I've done, all the stuff we've been sharing back and forth between us, the transcripts from this meetings, the transcripts from our WhatsApp.

All the things we've been creating together.  This thing has it under the hood and you can talk to it and ask it questions and figure out what's up in this community in our online spaces or whatever.  Okay? The code will come back up in a minute. I encourage you to do the thing.  Uh, no, no, no. Let's go back.

We gotta talk about our homies.  These are the peeps that make it happen. These are the people that, okay, listen, we raised $5,500 here tonight. Venue costs about 1,500 plus some other stuff. Food and drink costs, about 1,500 plus some other stuff. We try to pay the artists and people that are involved. It works out to about 5,000.

This time we brought in 5,500.  These are the people that help us kind of get past the line.  Dmitri Sege. 

Dmitri Sege. Sorry guys. I'm tired. [[Dimitri Schwartzman]] and is a realtor who's a father of many of the people in this room. 

He's got an amazing family and a lot of them are showing up here tonight. Um, Ron and Alon, Sev, our two brothers that run a really cool law firm, they give us 500 bucks a month to kind of keep the doors open.  Rival, you've seen what they've done. They dropped 10,000 on our community this year. They're dropping at least 20,000 on our community next year,  the upgrade that's Peter and I, we're just trying to get people like upgraded and upskilled along the way, and Peter is open to 30% off.

Thank you brother.  Uh, VHD.  Thanks guys for buying like the 10 pack right out the gate of tickets, you know, or whatever to the whole VCAI thing.  [[Darren Nicholls]]. [[Dean Shev]], thank you for your support.  [[Mark Busse]] created mornings. Jessica Liang, nook. That's a cool coworking space you get to go to if you feel like it. 

[[Lorraine Lowe]], Lucy Michael Space Center. Hey, I got a request right now that we clean up our shit after us and you clean up after your neighbor too, even if it ain't yours. Like I said, we get to hang out here and, um, partake and no one's, uh, uh, giving us pressure about nothing. So let's leave this place better than we found it. 

And Flik,  who was right there, but had to go meta creation lab guy's. Been running a creative AI lab in Surrey for almost 20 years at Sea O in, um, in Surrey. Amazing partner in lots of ways.  Ah, these are our peeps.  Are you here?  You Yeah, bro.  Um, UDA has a small contract right now as my chief of staff also.

We, uh, are gonna be roommates for the fall. So, uh, I just want to thank UDA for all the help you've been giving me,  Gabe, Zara.  You should try to hire him in the next 12 hours because I happen to know that he has an in, not an in like a final, final interview in the morning with one of the coolest companies any of you all have ever heard of with the CEO.

He's a, a community guy, available, but not for very long. I would do it while you can do it. I did it and he said yes. And so he's helping us out with a community here at BCAI. Thank you Gabe.  Um, mama. Thank you guys for coming. 

Victor  has been here since month two, making videos, laying down the archives, the permanent record.  Everyone Anthonia, maybe now's the time. 

Oh, okay. 

Yeah. Um,  actually, uh, [[Matthew Schwartzman]], maybe now's the time for you two.  Um, we got some special interest groups. We got things springing up all around us. That's why we built the whole nonprofit.

Right. And so I want to just invite Matthew and Anthonia for the moment. Um, riv, thank you for coming too. They get, they're both doing these, uh, AI and education. Sury ai. Keep it brief, y'all.  

What I got like 30 minutes or like 30 seconds.  

If you fan me, you can have as long 

as you want. Awesome, awesome, awesome. 

It's ridiculous. Um, oh my God. What an awesome night. This is actually my first one, but I've just been watching this. I've been watching the chat. Whoever's on that chat, like I wake up, there's like 40 messages. It's wild. Um, but as a part of that chat, there was a.edu. A couple people wanted to come together, start talking about education.

I'm from Ethos Lab. Uh, I'm the executive director, and what we do is we fuse science, technology, engineering, applied art and math and culture to be able to create greater access to young people in these areas of steam.  And, uh, and so saw a lot of the conversation happening on the EDU or a lot of like, not too much conversation happening on the EDU group.

Um, and we've got a 4,000 square foot space in Mount Pleasant, um, and are inviting anyone who's in the education space to come out, um, for, uh, EDU or education, uh, meetup, uh, in ai. So that is on, uh, the 11th of September. You can, uh, go to the chat. You could check that out. And then I also just wanna give a quick plug.

Uh, I got PJ right there in the back. Uh, one of our facilitators, we are running a weekly, um, AI experimentation group for youth in, uh, grades eight to grade 12. So if you got any high school students out there, um, what we heard from the kids and shout out to pwa. Yeah. This is the one, uh, PWA ol 

Wizard talked at it and 

PWA talked about it.

Prra exactly. Both came, uh, met with our, uh, youth AI working group and they said AI needs to be done in community and 

Prj. They said you were the best speaker of the, 

they. They were like, he, he is the best. So, um, that's starting, uh, September 19th. PJ's gonna be our facilitator. If you've got any high school students, uh, please help 'em to come out.

We, but if you're in edu, come out. 

We rolled past ETHOS last night with, uh, Jos and I and got the whole, we gotta meet pj. I invited him up here right now, but he'll blow your minds for like 35 minutes. And who needs that  at this moment? Right. But, um, thank you for coming, doing this. Thanks for mixing it up with us around like the AI and education stuff.

Yeah. I mean, from like.  How our kids should, what they should do after high school to like what role AI should play in the classroom to, like,  it's confusing and like some of the best teachers are experimenting and stuff like that. Yeah. But a lot of people aren't. They're fighting against it. They're bearing in their heads in the sand.

Like, uh, yeah. 

There's a lot of shame around it, especially within the black community as well too. Um, it's very, very difficult to engage in this, in space in a, a safe and and transparent way. And so what we know is that kids, while it's like they feel like it's cheating in school, they're experimenting and trying things on their own and alone.

And there's a lot of different types of, uh, you know, platforms out there that they should really be able to have critical conversations. Um, talk about decision making and decision hierarchies, what kind of tools to be using in open community. And so that's what we do at Ethos Lab. 

Yeah. 

And we also like to have lots of snacks.

You guys are awesome. 

I, this is one of the coolest projects going on in Vancouver right now. Thank you, Antonio. Awesome. Yeah. 

Um, speaking of cheating in school, we got,  we got [[Matthew Schwartzman]] up next.  Um,  kid put me on his podcast when he was still in high school. Then we started doing AI stuff together. Then I cheated, then he talked, told me how he took my techniques and fucking corrupted them and used them to cheat. But you've heard that story or you can check it out on the podcast.

So just give us a little hype about Surrey and tell us what's up. What's up riv? 

Siri ai. Okay. Um, we host monthly events Middle Tuesday of every single month. We have like 20, 30 people come by. It's, it's always a vibe. We all get to go around and kind of talk a little bit about ai. Um, so it's more personal and, you know, it's, we've been doing it for, uh, seven months now.

Six months now, seven months. Yeah. There you go. And, uh, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's always good. We maybe if somebody my age comes there, I'll teach him how to cheat,  but no promises.  

This guy's ridiculous. He's in charge of like the games in antics. He's like, this shit ain't fun enough. It's not interacting enough around here in Vancouver.

Let, let's pick which of these five beautiful people were generated by ai. I know you guys are all wrong. And then he just laughs at us. So ri tell us about your gimmicks and antics, man.  

Okay, so I started this thing called, is it AI or Not. So I give it a bunch of photos and I go, can you guess which ones AI or not?

And every month I like to mess with everyone in the room. I'm like, either I'm gonna make it really easy for you, or it's just a complete mind bubble. Like, what is this? What's going on? Who is what, what's happening? And it's been an incredible experience to do this with everyone in the room every month. 

So I, I want to, uh, offer everyone in this room this month for September 16th is our meetup actually. And I wanna give everyone 40% off in this room, uh, with the Code Van ai. Woo. 

I mean, listen, Maurice is there. Yes, Dean is there. Sev is there. Michelle Diamond is there. It's actually like, it's like this, but chiller, like we're all hanging out in the living room or whatever.

So it's pretty cool. Thank you very much guys. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, 

I already said my words about the space center. We can move on.  Thank you. Space center, let's clean up after ourselves. That's the point of this slide.  We just did a little bit of community announcements. Let's see if we can keep on trucking.  Uh, that's, that's we're, we're the, so YouTube channel and then, uh, graph stuff.

Alright, cool. Um, and that's what, do you wanna do that right now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, cool. Would you bring up the, my last, uh, QR code thing again? 

So this is that whole BCI association thing I was talking about that we're all doing here that I would like for you guys to become a part of. Uh, how many are we at right now? 34. 34 members signed up today. First day you could sign up through the website. That's paying members that represents us having a strong voice with like politicians, funding organizations, governments and stuff.

So I welcome you guys to welcome. Come check that shit out. Alright, Kevin. So Mr. Pixel, wizard went deep on Craf. And, uh, he brought us back a couple of his favorite things here in his, uh, two minute SIGGRAPH report. So, what's up Kevin? 

Alright, I'm gonna try and like run this a little bit to the side here 'cause it's a little bit of, uh, a couple of things.

So, uh, I'm gonna talk about a little bit about how SIGGRAPH is Patrick, are you still here? No,  that is the most Patrick answer.  You're wearing a white shirt and you're alone. There's no escaping.  Um, SIGGRAPH was absolutely incredible this year. Patrick, I know you're, you know, standing in the, in, in the coffers, but how would you say SIGGRAPH was this year?

It was very relaxed.  Yeah,  clearly, clearly. Um, I don't know. For me it was really special. It was my second, uh, SIGGRAPH that I attended and, and the caliber of people and the spirit and the energy of it this year was really off the charts and the local side, uh, um, uh, meetups that happened. Uh, the cross zone meetup, uh, on the Tuesday morning at Northeastern University was.

So incredible. There were so many turned on people there, uh, ready to play in all avenues of the AI space and, and bringing in the international folks as well was absolutely killer. So, uh, there were a couple of people that I met along the way that I really want to showcase, and I hope both of them are here tonight.

I know one is, um, and I'm just going to look up the name again because I have the, uh, memory of a parrot. Um,  John Mutter, are you here? Yes. All right. Come on up, man.  Um, John, I met at, uh, Z Space, uh, uh, on the last, um, kind of after party. And, uh, John tell us, you know, 10 seconds about yourself and we wanted to showcase something that, uh, that you've put together. 

Sure. Uh, my name is John. I'm a visual effects compositor, uh, director of photographer. And, uh, this is something I was just, uh, doing some experiments with generative ai. So about four weeks ago, I just started to check in to see where we were. This is a short, fake, uh, home shopping network video. I've been making a number of videos just to get the name of one of my websites into some content.

And so this is one of them. Uh, stills made in stable diffusion automatic 1111 video in Google VO three,  uh, script human written. The old, the old way, pen and pencil and text done, uh, in compositing software in nuke.  Back. 

Okay. I am really excited about the next item we have for sale. It is a bird's got your back.

Silver coin. Can we get a closeup on that? This is a beautiful piece. You can see the intricate details.  

Wow. Well, alright, I think I'm gonna have to get a couple of these. 

I should also mention that each coin comes with a link to the bird website. Birds got your back.com. It can be yours for just three easy payments of $6 and 99 cents. 

Oh fuck.  I stubbed my toe. 

Oh,  it  event. 

Thank you for watching. 

Thank you so much. Uh, John, that was awesome. Um, do we have one, uh, a two minute piece that we can do? Okay. Um, Ahmed, if you could, uh, come on up please.  Yeah, yeah.  Ahmed,  uh, hit the floor in a gorilla fashion and it was so cool. Um, I was literally sitting and chatting with someone and you were doing a demo with someone else in the lunch area and I was hearing a little bit about what you're up to and it was, it, it blew my mind.

And then you pulled me in and showed me afterwards and I was like, dude, this is amazing. So do you wanna just like, go right into it? Let's, all right, let's do this. Okay.  

Can we kill the stage lights? 

Alright. 3, 2, 1.  Okay, so my name is Ahmed and I have 20 years of experience in the game development industry. Having worked at startups as well as an engineering manager at AWS and instructor at VFS, um, my work have been featured consistently on B-B-C-C-M-B-C-I-G-N, and many others. My start was with Prince of Persia back in 1989.

I wanted to make cinematic action adventure games, a reality. I tried every tool that I could get my hands on. None of them allowed me to do an end-to-end approach so that I can make a game and publish it at the same time. So I decided to build one. Creative is a no-code platform that allows anyone to develop and publish commercial quality games on multiple platforms.

Let's take a look at a sneak peek. A creative you can build and discover different experiences. So basically, uh, everything you're about to see right now, um, has been made. Using creative, you can make infinite procedural open worlds filled with vegetation, with water effects that are simulated AC accounting for both the large scale as well as the small scale details  and with different weather environments both covering this world and beyond. 

You can use all of that through a simple, easy to use user interface to control all aspects of the scene populated with content coming from different theme packs, and basically add characters that will be, uh, interacting with this environment with rigid bodies, cloth animations, rope physics, and even destruction.

So the most complex issues of computer graphics today, we're solving with a single click, but it's not only games, it's also interactive applications, storytelling with offline animations and interactive walkthroughs that could be guided with ai. Speaking of ai, there is Gen ai. Of course, they don't let you into see graph if you don't have one.

And you can also, we are on a path to allow Vibe Deving. So you can describe a scene and see it come alive in front of you when you're done. You can publish to any of these platforms with a single click. If you're interested, please join Creative at the wait list and come more, more information coming and release. And the actual release is coming this October. Uh, talk to me if you're interested or if you know somebody who is interested. Thank you, Kevin and Kris Krüg. Thank you. 

All right. Thank you sir. Um, that was amazing. If you wanna, uh, have a chat, uh, with him, please connect with him. He'll show you in depth. It's really amazing in real time. Cig graph was a real blast. It's a real sort of change in the industry at the moment, uh, from, you know, uh, gaming and, and, and 3D as as we knew it, and working in copilot with AI tools.

And we really saw that this year. And in that spirit, we're starting a film, uh, uh, um, component of the Van AI meetups, hopefully starting in September. We've got the WhatsApp group going right now. So if you're interested in that part of it, stay tuned on that one. So thank you very much. All 

that's a wrap.  Thank you for coming. September 24th, next event. There's a bunch of cool shit going on between now and then. The bar's still open for 45 minutes. I think there's still a bunch of glob jam in today's Lord Ganesha's birthday. So, Ooh, Bob told me, let's get some vegetarian food and celebrate.

There's a bunch of yummy stuff left. Uh, thank you again very much for coming.  Hug my mom. Before you go, if you need a hug,  

who says a, I says innovation for the innovation.  

Who  says training? Created training Power. Who says power says what Side.
